"Collaborative Teamwork, Time Management, Confidence in Dissertation",1,0.9934,"At the beginning of this project, I was excited to explore gender differences in perception, particularly how gendered language shapes attitudes towards job roles. Initially, I had to adapt my original idea due to other team members focusing on similar areas. Despite being initially disappointed, I remained open-minded and embraced the opportunity to work in a team. I enjoyed working with my partner overall, but collaboration came with difficulties. One challenge was our disagreement over using visual stimuli; I wanted to present job ads within stereotypically masculine and feminine office spaces, but we couldn't agree on their appearance, resulting in a change of direction that delayed progress. A significant challenge for me was SPSS; I initially felt overwhelmed by it but grew more confident as time passed. Unfortunately, technical issues led to the loss of data outputs, preventing me from recreating graphs shown to Caroline. Although I'm proud of the work submitted, it's not as comprehensive as it could have been. Moving forward, I understand the importance of completing tasks ahead of deadlines and seeking help when things go wrong. The project has highlighted the significance of visual and language-based framing in gendered communication, especially within marketing. In future projects, especially my final-year dissertation, I'd like to explore topics that integrate academic interests with professional fields, focusing on the power of gendered words and improving my ability to create engaging experimental materials reflective of real-world applications. Although this project may not be the piece I'm most proud of, it served as a turning point in my perception of myself as a researcher, providing clarity on values, voice, and future explorations. At submission, I feel a mix of pride, frustration, and relief but primarily motivated for what comes next. || At the beginning of this project, I was excited to explore gender differences in perception, particularly how gendered language shapes attitudes towards job roles.

Collaboration and Project Management,1,0.9877,"Working on this project has highlighted both the strengths and challenges of collaborative group work. Effective communication is essential not just in sharing ideas but in ensuring that everyone has a clear understanding of their role and deadlines. At times, our group struggled with coordination, especially when tasks overlapped or lacked ownership, which led to delays and occasional frustration. However, I also saw the value in diverse perspectives, as each member brought unique insights that enriched the final outcome. In future projects, I would suggest implementing clearer structures from the beginning; assigning roles early, setting regular check-ins, and using shared digital tools for transparency and task tracking. Building a sense of accountability and encouraging open feedback within the group can greatly enhance motivation and performance. Most importantly, I have come to appreciate the importance of flexibility, balancing individual strengths with group dynamics and being adaptable when plans change. || Working on this project has highlighted both the strengths and challenges of collaborative group work.

"Collaboration, Effective Data Management, Clear Study Design",1,0.9982,"Looking back, my research journey did not start smoothly. Allocated a lab group whose interests revolved around conspiracy theories, which clashed with academic goals. Frustrating but taught importance of working with team focused on genuine, evidence-based research. Dove into extensive research in area of interest, reviewing existing studies to find gaps we could address, building strong foundation for project relevant to Perception of Witness Credibility and well-structured. Came up with three potential study designs, inviting teammates to help decide which one to pursue, ensuring everyone felt included and invested in project. Strong understanding of subject and motivation led to leadership role during planning phase. Faced challenge of combining everyone's different ideas into single clear plan while maintaining scientific accuracy. Collaboration tricky due to varying levels of knowledge among group members, often guiding direction of study while keeping everyone engaged. Major obstacle was unexpectedly long duration of study causing many participants to drop out. Despite smooth randomization process, lower-than-expected participant numbers pushed me to recruit more around campus. This was challenging but boosted confidence in promoting research and reaching out to people. Organizing data took effort, analyzing it rewarding, revealing interesting findings. Struggled with urge to overanalyze results, reminding myself of importance of staying disciplined in interpreting data. Experience taught me how to design future studies more efficiently. Working in team presented challenges due to preference for working alone. Project encouraged letting go of control and trusting teammates with different parts of research, key moment for personal growth. Realized tendency to overwork and focus on small details sometimes slowed us down. Created overly complicated data sheets that confused teammates, requiring extra time to explain thought process. This experience highlighted importance of keeping things simple in research. Lessons learned from this experience will be invaluable as move on to third-year dissertation and future projects. Now have deeper appreciation for collaborative research, effective data management, and the importance of clear study design. Excited to apply these insights to upcoming work ensuring scientific accuracy and practicality. || Looking back, my research journey did not start smoothly.

"Collaboration, Leadership, Overcoming Challenges, Navigating University System, Independence, Future Preparations",1,0.9424,"Throughout the decision-making process, I learned the value of compromise and collaboration. There were times when I had to make sacrifices for group cohesion, and this taught me a valuable lesson: never to overvalue my own perspective above others. Everyone brings their own passion and reasoning to the table, and I've learned to give others' ideas the same energy and consideration I give my own. One of the main challenges we faced as a group was the difference in priorities, motivation, and discipline when it came to data collection and completing the project. Realistically, only two of us fully contributed, which made the workload unfairly distributed. This was frustrating at times, but it taught me a lot about leadership, patience, and accountability. Another significant challenge was the lack of a reliable structure within the university. The system often felt inconsistent and unclear, with different tutors and lecturers offering conflicting information. It was difficult to feel confident in the direction we were taking, especially when guidance varied so widely. Additionally, there seemed to be an imbalance in support - some students had access to module leaders, while others were assigned to fellows who couldn't provide definitive answers. This created an uneven playing field and made it harder to feel confident in our work. We had to make several adjustments during the project, such as introducing a control variable and increasing the number of scenarios, which required flexibility and extra time that wasn't always easy to find under these conditions. At the point of submission, I feel uneasy. There are still aspects of the project that remain unclear, and I worry that by the time proper help arrives, it'll be too late. Looking ahead to next year, I feel nervous. Working closely with a professor is something I'm expected to do, but based on my experience so far, I worry that I'll encounter the same lack of structure and support. In all honesty, I would prefer to work independently - at least that way, the outcome is fully in my hands, and I'm not left waiting on a system or individuals that aren't consistent. Still, I'm hopeful that with the lessons I've learned this year, I'll be able to navigate future challenges with more resilience and clarity. || Throughout the decision-making process, I learned the value of compromise and collaboration.

"Collaboration, Perseverance, Methodology Improvement",1,0.5447,"The prospect of conducting a mini dissertation initially daunted me, given my preference for independent work. However, my team swiftly developed a strong bond, and I greatly enjoyed collaborating with them. Unfortunately, from December, I was diagnosed with a chronic health condition that required me to be under supervision when leaving home for extended periods. One of my team members and I maintained regular communication about the project during this time, which allowed me to stay involved in our collective effort. This proved vital as I grew increasingly anxious about the project. This experience taught me that even during difficult personal circumstances, projects like these can still be completed through open communication. The data analysis was intimidating due to my weak numerical skills; it took a considerable amount of time and multiple attempts to execute the test correctly. However, learning in this manner offered a sense of accomplishment when I finally ran it without errors, boosting my confidence in conducting statistical tests in the future. I was disheartened not to find a significant result, especially since the Crime Type effect was close to statistical significance. This experience left me eager to conduct further research in search of a meaningful outcome and prompted me to reflect on ways to improve my methodology. I now look forward to conducting more research in the future and exploring various ideas, regardless of whether a significant result is achieved or not. I've realized that when designing a study, it cannot be perfect; there will always be limitations, but the objective should be to continually refine and enhance research over time. || The prospect of conducting a mini dissertation initially daunted me, given my preference for independent work.

"Collaborative Learning, Research Design, Technology Adaptation, Confidence Building",1,0.9954,"To have the opportunity to create a research project during our second year was extremely helpful; I am very grateful as it has got me excited for next year's dissertation. Working in a group was extremely useful, as everyone was proactive and determined to create the best study we could. There were debates about creating the study, but nothing that created an awkward environment or wasn't immediately resolved, strengthening our work ethic. We had issues with creating independent and dependent variables at first, but with help from each other and our lab tutor, we overcame those difficulties. I particularly enjoyed using Gorilla software for this study, as it provided insight into what I can use next year for my research project. Although understanding the software was difficult initially, specifically the data collection spreadsheets, I quickly developed my understanding of the software and created an effective online study. The whole group contributed to creating the Gorilla study, so help was always available when needed. I also enjoyed the statistics side of psychology as I do not mind SPSS, making analysis successful, and brushing up on my skills made me more confident. Overall, this process was extremely fulfilling, and I enjoyed working with this group to create a study. This experience helped me identify my weaknesses and areas for improvement before third year, and I now know what was successful for me, which I can use when brainstorming for my dissertation project. || To have the opportunity to create a research project during our second year was extremely helpful; I am very grateful as it has got me excited for next year's dissertation.

"Complexity of Academic Research, Data Analysis, Planning, Flexibility, Adaptability",1,0.981,"This project's decision-making demonstrated the impact of planning and flexibility on outcomes. Goals were established for sociability, academic performance, and belonging. My hypothesis suggested that sociability would influence belongingness more than academic success. The project encountered challenges, primarily in the literature review stage. Prior studies had linked sociability and belonging. A broader research focus was necessary. After reviewing literature and findings, it became clear that numerous social, environmental, and individual factors might impact belongingness, which the research design could not fully account for. Instead, sociability and academic success predicted belongingness. Consequently, I altered my study topic to better analyze the data. Data analysis proved challenging. Interpreting 2x2 ANOVA results without significant effects was difficult. I attempted to reconcile the lack of relevance with evidence supporting the importance of sociability. After further contemplation, I recognized these findings might necessitate a deeper understanding of belongingness and personal and institutional issues. At one point, I considered giving up. However, study technique, data processing, and adaptability helped me navigate unexpected results. Next year, I am more confident in my hypotheses, critical research skills, and adaptability.

"Empirical Research, Personal Growth, Collaboration, Data Analysis",1,0.9921,"Reflecting on my mini dissertation experience, I've gained valuable insights into both the research process and my personal growth as a researcher. From the beginning, I was fortunate to have a group as passionate and determined as myself. Everyone was excited to conduct in-person research, making the whole process more enjoyable and engaging. I had a clear vision of my research topic from the first Research-Methods lecture, as I had explored it in my own previous studies. Through discussions with my supervisor and research group, we narrowed the focus to mindfulness meditation, making the whole project more manageable and effective long term. At first, we thought we were all researching the same topic together, so for a while, there was some minor confusion with our IVs and DVs but that was soon resolved. The other three members of my group focused on related topics such as mindfulness states during meditation and heart rate during the types of meditation, creating a collaborative atmosphere that motivated us all to dive deeper into our research. One challenge I encountered was analyzing and interpreting the data, but this taught me the importance of being flexible and adjusting interpretations when things do not go as planned. Originally, we had built a single-electrode EEG system to measure brain activity, but after facing difficulties, the decision was made to switch to measuring HRV. Though frustrating, this change happened early, allowing us to adapt quickly and keep moving forward. We spent two months in our experimental room, refining our methods and collecting data. Overall, this experience deepened my appreciation for empirical research and will shape how I approach future projects. For example, I was inspired to use quantitative data for my third-year dissertation as this process of collecting data was exciting. This research has helped guide me to my choices for conducting my data in the future. || Reflecting on my mini dissertation experience, I've gained valuable insights into both the research process and my personal growth as a researcher. From the beginning, I was fortunate to have a group as passionate and determined as myself. Everyone was excited to conduct in-person research, making the whole process more enjoyable and engaging. I had a clear vision of my research topic from the first Research-Methods lecture, as I had explored it in my own previous studies. Through discussions with my supervisor and research group, we narrowed the focus to mindfulness meditation, making the whole project more manageable and effective long term. At first, we thought we were all researching the same topic together, so for a while, there was some minor confusion with our IVs and DVs but that was soon resolved. The other three members of my group focused on related topics such as mindfulness states during meditation and heart rate during the types of meditation, creating a collaborative atmosphere that motivated us all to dive deeper into our research. One challenge I encountered was analyzing and interpreting the data, but this taught me the importance of being flexible and adjusting interpretations when things do not go as planned.

"Independent Research, Teamwork, Time Management, Data Analysis, Personal Growth",1,0.9839,"Initially, the concept of producing my own research seemed incredibly daunting and unachievable. Confusing and intense work to complete individually, starting a group project and writing the lab report independently. However, members did not attend a large percentage of lab sessions and did not contribute equally when designing the study and making resources. This experience taught the importance of reliable teammates and active communication between group members to minimize conflict and ensure an even distribution of work. Despite this, the other group members worked effectively together to meet deadlines. Although it was a significant workload, lab times and internal deadlines recommended by lab tutors helped turn the work into manageable pieces. Data analysis was intimidating at first; however, we surpassed our expected number of participants and had a larger sample size. This created an obstacle: an Excel spreadsheet over 100 rows long. It took trial and error, but with help from our lab tutor and YouTube videos, we processed our data to the stage where we could run an ANOVA. This experience highlighted that making mistakes initially is okay and can often be reversed or remedied. It also showed how much just trying can teach you. Although it took a few attempts, eventually, variables were transformed. This feeling of self-achievement was shortly replaced with disappointment as my results were not significant. After discussing with my lab tutor, I realized that non-significant results are still important. I feel this is an incredibly important realization for an aspiring psychologist. My research found a contradiction to previous research, although the analysis may have been non-significant; the contradiction is a significant contribution to the field. It is important to learn not to be disappointed by this. Ultimately, I now feel more confident with the idea of completing my own completely independent dissertation next year. I feel more comfortable with data analysis and have a good idea of which aspects are the most time-consuming or require the most attention. It has also given me valuable experience in organizing my time to make a very large and daunting project more approachable by setting internal deadlines and holding myself accountable.

"Planning, Research Design, Data Analysis, Communication",1,0.9963,"The initial stages of formulating my research question proved difficult as we collaboratively identified the broader topic of VR exposure therapy for public speaking anxiety but isolating my specific focus on motivation proved challenging. This difficulty extended to finding existing research that directly assessed motivation or its interaction with VR exposure therapy and anxiety reduction. Lack of direct precedent made it hard to establish my research question and independent variables from the outset, deviating from established protocols, further complicated the process. In future, I will conduct more in-depth research prior to starting a project, ensuring a clear understanding of the research question and independent variables from the very beginning. Accessing VR equipment presented another hurdle due to limited availability and shared use with other research groups resulting in delays during data collection. For future projects, I will prioritize materials that are readily accessible to avoid similar delays.

While ethical considerations were paramount, finding participants with a debilitating fear of public speaking proved difficult. The relaxed environment, privacy, and lack of time constraints might have contributed to this. Additionally, the VR app ""Ovation"", while engaging, may not have provided a sufficiently realistic experience. Many participants found the VR experience enjoyable rather than stressful, potentially impacting the severity of the exposure. In future research, I will consider including a control group to better determine if observed changes are truly due to the treatment. Furthermore, the reliance on self-report measures raises concerns about potential bias from placebo effects or participants' desire to present themselves favorably. A control group would help mitigate these concerns and enhance the reliability of the experiment.

Analyzing the data using SPSS proved to be the most challenging aspect of the project. My understanding of SPSS and statistics, while improving, still requires further development. The complexity of the study design and analyses pushed me to seek guidance from my lab tutor, take detailed notes, and utilize online resources. This experience highlighted the ongoing learning curve in data analysis and reinforced the need for continued practice.

The experiment's design was strong, yielding significant results and exploring motivation, a relatively understudied area. Communication within the group was effective, particularly in coordinating data collection. However, communication with participants could have been improved. The complexity of the ""Ovation"" app, along with technical issues, led to misinterpretations and disruptions during the VR sessions. In future research, I will provide clearer instructions, potentially incorporating visual aids like picture demonstrations or videos.

Despite the challenges, this research contributes to understanding the potential effectiveness of VR exposure therapy for anxiety reduction. My findings suggest that motivation may play a role even with less realistic VR experiences. Future research could build upon this by improving VR realism, incorporating a control group, and investigating different types of motivation. This experience has reinforced the importance of having access to reliable equipment, providing clear participant instructions, and developing statistical analysis skills for smooth and effective research.

"Psychology Research Methods, Independence, Perseverance",1,0.9757,"Completing this mini-dissertation was both a challenging and rewarding experience. At the outset, I was intrigued by the idea that subtle communication cues - such as a speaker's title or use of medical jargon - could influence how individuals perceive their own health. Designing a 2x2 factorial experiment allowed me to explore this in a structured, empirical way. However, transforming an abstract idea into a fully realized study required constant critical thinking, organization, and attention to detail. One of the most valuable aspects of this project was learning how to operationalize variables, particularly self-rated health (SRH). Adapting items from the SF-36 survey and reverse coding them taught me about the importance of handling measurement tools carefully to ensure validity. Writing the Methods and Results sections helped solidify my understanding of statistical testing, especially two-way ANOVA, and the importance of power analysis. I also gained experience navigating Qualtrics for randomisation and survey design. Perhaps the most significant growth came during the Discussion section, where I had to critically evaluate my findings, acknowledge limitations, and consider future directions. While my hypotheses were only partially supported, this taught me that null or unexpected results are still meaningful and can inform theory and practice. Overall, this project deepened my understanding of how psychology research is conducted and the importance of methodological transparency. It also reinforced my ability to manage anxiety under pressure, work independently, and persevere through complex tasks - skills I will carry forward in my academic and professional journey. || Completing this mini-dissertation was both a challenging and rewarding experience.

Research Design & Methodology,3,0.9588,"My comprehension of outcome bias and decision evaluation difficulties has significantly improved due to this research. A within-subjects study compelled me to evaluate order effect control and measurement reliability critically. This approach enhanced my understanding of experimental design, and the importance of methodological accuracy. Performing a 2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA on the data increased my statistical confidence, and I learned the importance of interpreting effect sizes and testing assumptions rather than just focusing on significance. Reading literature improved my ability to critically assess previous studies and place my findings in broader psychological debate contexts. This project honed my analytical thinking, problem-solving, attention to detail, and technical skills, all vital for further study. Impartiality in judgment was reaffirmed as valuable in both academic and practical contexts. In conclusion, this experience boosted my respect for scientific investigation and made me a more systematic and thoughtful researcher during my academic career. || Reflecting on the decision-making process of our research project, our group started with numerous ideas for various topics and eventually confirmed the topic at hand. I have learned a great deal about the complexity of studying the impact of media on public perception. One of the initial challenges we faced was narrowing down the topic. Initially, we wanted to do something related to criminal psychology but found it too broad to finalize a suitable and appropriate topic. In the end, we focused on something we encounter frequently in real life and implemented it. Throughout the project, I struggled with data collection, particularly recruiting a diverse enough group of participants. The majority of respondents were college students, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, due to our low impact, we often struggled with anxiety during the survey process as to whether or not we would get enough responses to the questionnaire. Upon submitting my thesis, I felt both a sense of accomplishment and relief. I was satisfied with the results of the research and the insights it provided into the role of media in shaping public fear. As I look forward to next year, I am more confident in my research abilities, but I also recognize that there is still much to learn about methodology and academic writing. This project has been a valuable learning experience, and I look forward to further improving my abilities in future research so that I can study criminal psychology topics next year."

For future collaborations, I will strive for evenly distributed workload and clearer communication. This would have allowed for improved study design, a larger sample size, and enhanced materials via video recording instead of using a written vignette. Additionally, narrowing the scope of my research was challenging due to my interest in ASD. This led to covering multiple areas within my lab report, such as the double empathy problem, misdiagnosis in women, and issues with previous research, resulting in exceeding the word count by double. For future projects, I will plan ahead and approximate word counts for each section. Despite these challenges, I enjoyed this project due to its relevance to my interests. Designing my study provided insight into the process of being a researcher."
"Research Design, Data Analysis, Learning, Future Plans",1,0.9896,"During this time, I designed, composed, and completed my experiment and mini-dissertation. Many decisions needed to be made such as choosing IV (Independent Variable) and DV (Dependent Variable), which was difficult due to differing opinions. We eventually chose one idea each that fit into similar categories. My choice was attachment style, intriguing and suitable for studying alongside relationship satisfaction and impulsivity. We chose a questionnaire because it was straightforward and easy for analysis but preprocessing the data proved complex with vast amounts requiring coding and conversion into meaningful data plots. Deciding what to include and exclude presented challenges. The ethical approval process posed difficulties, with many sends back and rejects before approval. We had to keep making small changes to the design and variables to gain approval. Errors in the questionnaire design after publishing caused processing and translating issues, leading to adjustments within data analysis like reverse coding the data, adding different representatives, using means, and discluding certain data that would have hindered processing and study results. If I were to repeat this study, I might use a different basis of measurement and questionnaires. I'd carefully compose the questionnaire with this in mind. I feel relieved at submission, as it was stressful, but excited for next year and my main dissertation. I learned much from this experience and enjoyed most of the challenges along the way. I am eager to explore new topics and construct something based on my interests and future career in psychology. || During this time, I designed, composed, and completed my experiment and mini-dissertation.

"Research Design, Data Analysis, Personal Growth",1,0.9853,"Working as a group has always been a mixed experience for me, involving highly engaged members and those who contribute less. At the start of our project, the group dynamic lacked cohesion, with few actively participating while others either worked independently without communicating or remained largely disengaged. This lack of coordination left some unaware of the project's progress, making collaboration difficult. As the project developed, collaboration improved and became more effective. Despite initial difficulties, I found the experience enjoyable because we had autonomy over a topic that interested us all. One key difficulty was our complex research design; enthusiasm led to including multiple variables, complicating the study. This confusion affected data analysis. Reflecting, I acknowledge the importance of clear, focused research questions and manageable designs for future projects. Data analysis proved challenging, as interpreting Qualtrics data and navigating SPSS initially felt overwhelming. Despite guidance, I struggled with certain concepts, but this struggle refined my research skills. Moving forward, I will dedicate time to improving proficiency in SPSS and statistical analysis for the final-year dissertation. Challenges included a small sample size limiting reliability, difficulty recruiting participants, participant fatigue causing missing data, and designing an engaging yet concise study. These issues taught me about common research problems such as poor measure selection, small sample sizes, and participant dropout, and their impact on findings interpretation.

"Research Design, Emotion Recognition, Methodological Considerations",1,0.9746,"Conducting this study on gender and emotional valence in recognizing emotional intensity through eye contact has been an insightful journey. From developing the research question to analyzing data, I have gained a deeper appreciation for the complexities of nonverbal communication and emotional perception. One of the most surprising findings was the lack of significant main effects for gender and emotional valence, despite previous research suggesting otherwise. However, the significant interaction effect - where female participants showed greater accuracy in recognizing negative emotions - raised important questions about socialization processes and cognitive biases in emotion recognition. This encouraged me to critically assess existing theories and acknowledge the intricate nature of these psychological mechanisms. Methodologically, I became more aware of the trade-offs in experimental design. While static eye images provided control, they lacked real-world dynamism. Future research using videos or interactive stimuli could yield more ecologically valid insights. Additionally, the gender imbalance in my sample (34 males, 66 females) may have influenced the findings, highlighting the importance of balanced participant recruitment. Reflecting on broader implications, my study connects with practical fields like psychotherapy, education, and AI development. This experience has deepened my curiosity about emotion perception and inspired future research directions into cultural and personality-based influences. || Conducting this study on gender and emotional valence in recognizing emotional intensity through eye contact has been an insightful journey.

"Research Design, Project Management",1,0.988,"This mini-dissertation project offered valuable insights into the research process, particularly regarding the challenges and adaptations essential for designing and conducting independent studies. Initially, our team designed a complex study examining the relationship between anxiety through a GAD-7 questionnaire, stress, exposure to anxiety-inducing stimuli (comparing cute dog videos versus stressful tasks), and subsequent sleep quality (to be measured through a two-part questionnaire completed before and after sleep). However, we encountered several significant methodological challenges that prompted us to rethink our approach. The primary issues included substantial participant attrition for the second part of the questionnaire. Although we had a reasonable number of participants to complete the initial anxiety assessment, fewer than half continued with completing the sleep quality follow-up questionnaire. Additionally, concerning signs were noted on the validity of the data collected - as the majority who completed both questionnaire parts did so within an unreasonably short timeframe (in less than 30 minutes from the start time to submission) rather than the originally expected overnight period from 6-12 hours. This pattern suggested participants were completing both sections in a single sitting, invalidating our attempt to measure the post-sleep effects. These challenges call for the pivotal need to anticipate participant behavior cautiously and implement follow-up mechanisms accordingly, such as sending morning reminder emails (a measure which we had discussed during planning but eventually dismissed due to technical constraints).

   As a result of these obstacles, I have changed the current study design examining gender and ethnicity effects on anxiety, in a less procedurally complex way which still addresses meaningful psychological questions. This experience has given me valuable takeaways about research design, and the importance of striking the balance between ambitious methodology and practical feasibility. As a result of this study, I will bear in mind several crucial considerations when I undertake my third-year dissertation. First, sample representativeness relies significantly on participant recruitment strategies. Our reliance on university forums and group chats resulted in a demographically skewed sample, limiting generalisability. Second, more advanced project management skills will be highly essential for an 8,000-word project, in terms of planning project deliverables along the timeline of milestones. Through studying exemplary papers, I have also enhanced my academic writing skills in presenting the results and discussion sections.

Forensic psychology stood out as an area of deep interest, especially in critiquing current investigative methods. Through an extensive literature review, we found that criminal profiling is often viewed as an outdated or abandoned technique. This discovery sparked our curiosity about the cognitive mechanisms involved in suspect identification – specifically, how individuals rely on superficial cues, contextual information, and whether implicit biases distort judgment due to profiling's reliance on subjective interpretation rather than objective, empirical evidence.

For example, using mostly psychology students as participants reduced the generalisability and ecological validity of my findings. Despite the struggles, especially with statistics, I feel proud of what I've learned. The experience improved my academic writing and taught me to approach data more carefully and analytically. Moving forward, I will carry these skills into future assignments and research, feeling more prepared and confident as a psychology student. || Completing this mini dissertation was a valuable yet challenging learning experience. One of the most difficult aspects for me was using SPSS. Navigating the software, labeling variables correctly, and interpreting outputs were initially overwhelming. I made mistakes when entering data or selecting tests, which affected my confidence. However, through practice, feedback, and external guidance, I gradually became more comfortable with running appropriate analyses, including a 2x2 mixed ANOVA.

Research Process and Psychological Study Design,1,0.9729,"Conducting this experiment was a challenging yet rewarding experience that taught me a lot about the research process. One of the most important lessons I learned was the importance of choosing the right measures. In hindsight, I should have used a mood survey that assessed general mood, not mood in the moment. As the survey only captured how participants were feeling at that exact time, it likely missed patterns in their usual emotional state, which may have affected the results. Recruiting participants went better than expected, and I was pleased to meet the sample size needed for analysis. Collecting and managing data provided practical experience with tools like Qualtrics and SPSS and helped me understand how to apply ethical guidelines in real-world research. Interpreting the results was both exciting and thought-provoking. It was encouraging to see a clear link between social media use and body dissatisfaction, but I was surprised that mood didn't play a bigger role. This reflection led me to consider the strengths and limitations of my design and measures. Overall, this project boosted my confidence and gave me a much deeper understanding of what's involved in running a psychological study from start to finish. || Conducting this experiment was a challenging yet rewarding experience that taught me a lot about the research process.

"Research Process, Teamwork, Methodology, Critical Thinking",1,0.9808,"Completing empirical research project on the interaction between extraversion, emotional context, and emotion perception via eye contact was a highly informative experience that deepened my understanding of the research process and improved my skills in psychological inquiry. Initially, developing hypotheses was straightforward and supported extensive literature. However, unexpected results such as introverts outperforming extraverts in accurately perceiving negative emotions challenged assumptions and emphasized the importance of maintaining flexibility in research expectations. One valuable lesson I learned is the significance of methodological rigor, highlighted by notable differences observed when using averages versus summed scores. This underscored my awareness that seemingly minor analytical decisions can critically impact research findings and interpretations. While participating in this project, my teamwork skills were strengthened. Although one group member consistently missed weekly lab sessions, causing coordination and communication difficulties, the rest of us established a strong collaborative relationship. This enabled us to successfully meet essential internal deadlines including critical proposal, ethics form, data collection stages. Importantly, diverse perspectives greatly enriched the analysis and interpretation stages of the research, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of our findings. Reflecting on this experience, I recognize the critical importance of proactive communication, structured planning, clear delegation of roles in group settings.

This opportunity has prepared me for how demanding my dissertation will be next year and put me in a great spot for what to expect."
Skill Development & Learning Experience,1,0.8243,"The Mini-Dissertation experience was a rollercoaster, enjoyable yet stressful; confidence grew significantly throughout. Group work fostered teamwork and communication skills, although it did not fully alleviate confusion experienced. Each individual's process was unique and fast-paced, making one feel behind at times. However, valuable lessons were learned for next year. The initial encounter with exported data on Excel was overwhelming, but upon understanding, realized its simplicity. Running and interpreting the data was difficult due to extended time since writing a lab report. Nonetheless, managed to complete in the end. In conclusion, this process initiated thoughts about potential 3rd-year research topics and provided a rough idea of the process. Acquired skills include critical thinking, exporting data, interpreting and cleaning data, and refreshing SPSS skills (creating graphs and reading descriptive statistics). Overall, the experience was incredibly beneficial despite being stressful and confusing at times. || The Mini-Dissertation experience was a rollercoaster, enjoyable yet stressful; confidence grew significantly throughout.

Teamwork & Collaboration,1,0.9643,"At the start of the year, even thinking about a mini dissertation was daunting. I felt unprepared. As we formed groups and brainstormed ideas, I originally felt worried that as a group, we wouldn't be able to come together and produce a piece of work that we were all proud of. However, the difficulty of this project brought our small group together, and we supported each other throughout the process. Throughout the process of picking a topic, allocating variables and interactions for us all to choose, and then getting started with the study formation, we began to work together much more seamlessly than when we started. Working in a group has taught me how to rely on others for parts I feel less confident in. I also learned to lend a helping hand to my colleagues when they were feeling less confident in an area that I was confident in. This experience has helped a lot with the feeling of impending doom when thinking about my dissertation next year as I already know what I need to do to get started and what to focus on. I feel much more confident about going into year 3, knowing how to produce a piece of work that I can be proud of. || At the start of the year, even thinking about a mini dissertation was daunting.

"Teamwork, Communication, Research Process",1,0.9898,"Overall, my experience with this dissertation was quite challenging and at times frustrating. While it was nice to work as a team for a change and share ideas regarding the research and study setup, the process was often hindered by one group member's frequent absence. This made the dissertation feel more like a two-person project, and having an extra, more engaged member might have made the experience run much more smoothly. A major issue throughout was the lack of communication outside of our lab sessions, which is something we all could have improved upon. Since we rarely interacted beyond those two hours, it was often difficult to stay on the same page.

   A good example of this miscommunication occurred over the Christmas break when we had planned to help each other with the Ethics Submission documents. However, when it came to the information sheet, we were left in the dark and had to create one ourselves, only to later discover that the absent group member had made their own version without informing us. Additionally, there were times when I asked questions and received no response from my fellow researchers, which made aspects of the project even more difficult.

   Another significant challenge was my experience with SPSS. For most of the year, I was unable to access the software, and even when I resolved the issue, there were instances where SPSS would not seem to generate data. This was incredibly frustrating, but in the end, it was a huge relief when everything finally worked as expected.

   Despite these challenges, I found our lab teacher to be incredibly helpful throughout the process as they supported our ideas, encouraged us, and told us what needed to be done to overcome any problems we may face. Their guidance made a significant difference, especially with regards to the Impact of Nicotine Withdrawal and Anhedonia when we struggled to understand certain aspects of the study or needed clarification on our methodology.

   Their support helped bridge some of the gaps caused by the lack of team communication, and I really appreciated their patience and expertise. While this experience had its difficulties, it has given me a clearer understanding of the research process and the importance of effective teamwork. Despite the frustrations faced from this mini dissertation, I am still looking forward to investigating my third-year dissertation independently, where I can take full control of my research and be better organized when it comes to setting up my research. || Overall, my experience with this dissertation was quite challenging and at times frustrating.

What I learned during the first month of brainstorming is that it may be better to work with people who have some level of intelligence rather than those I am familiar with. Eventually, decisions were made and the process began of forming our experiment. During this stage, task delegation was difficult and there were teammates who did not pull their weight.

Our ability to coordinate meetings and discussions ensured that everyone stayed informed, even when one of us couldn't attend a lab session. We made it a priority to keep each other updated which demonstrated the importance of teamwork and communication. I enjoyed working in a group, as the Ethics application initially overwhelmed me with the workload, but we all worked together to submit it on time, making it less stressful. While we were told it might be difficult to get our target sample population, I was very proud of how efficiently we distributed our questionnaire and how quickly we gathered all the necessary responses. I found the templates on the VLE very useful for setting up a Qualtrics questionnaire and was surprised by how straightforward it was. However, data analysis was hard. Working with raw data in Excel was difficult due to my limited experience, but working with my team to analyze the data together made it manageable. The other challenge I faced was interpreting the data from SPSS. With many tables provided, I found it hard to determine which were most relevant for the lab report, therefore the results section took longer to write. Despite these challenges, I enjoyed conducting my research.

We made it a priority to keep each other updated which demonstrated the importance of teamwork and communication. I enjoyed working in a group, as the Ethics application initially overwhelmed me with the workload, but we all worked together to submit it on time, making it less stressful. While we were told it might be difficult to get our target sample population, I was very proud of how efficiently we distributed our questionnaire and how quickly we gathered all the necessary responses. I found the templates on the VLE very useful for setting up a Qualtrics questionnaire and was surprised by how straightforward it was. However, data analysis was hard. Working with raw data in Excel was difficult due to my limited experience, but working with my team to analyze the data together made it manageable. The other challenge I faced was interpreting the data from SPSS. With many tables provided, I found it hard to determine which were most relevant for the lab report, therefore the results section took longer to write. Despite these challenges, I enjoyed conducting my research. This experience has improved my confidence in research design, data collection, and statistical analysis, which will be useful for my third-year dissertation. More importantly, I have also learned the significance of teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving in research, which will help me in my future job."
"Teamwork, Study Design, Perseverance",1,0.9345,"The mini-dissertation process presented several challenges, primarily due to group work involvement. Group members did not know each other personally before starting the project and were introverts, making it hard to build rapport and establish a common purpose. Initially, we struggled with social engagement, adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy for collaboration. Over time, we began supporting each other and working together more effectively. A significant challenge was our larger group size, making cohesive study design difficult. Additionally, we lacked a solid understanding of 2x2 ANOVA initially, which caused confusion.

   A crucial moment for me occurred when I missed a lab session, during which crucial design changes were made without my input. In my absence, other members took on main effects, leaving me with interactions. Once data collection concluded, our tutor recommended swapping one independent variable with one dependent variable to enhance clarity. This placed me in a challenging situation, as I had not been involved in selecting or applying the survey relevant to that part of the project. As a result, I analyzed a design in which I had only been partially involved.

   From this experience, I learned that designing a study is crucial and that a divide-and-conquer approach is not the best way to manage group work. If given another chance, I would choose to be more involved in every part of the project from the beginning. Despite these challenges, I feel good about my submission, and I am eager for the next year's project as I have learned a lot. I have already selected my project topic and met with my supervisor, who agreed with my proposal.

"Teamwork, Time Management, Personal Growth",1,0.9972,"The mini-dissertation was a group project conducted during the second year. In Term One, we designed an experiment for a 2x2 ANOVA; in Term Two, we executed the experiment and wrote the dissertation. It is essential to note that I previously attempted to complete the second year of this course but had to take a leave of absence due to health issues during the start of the second term. This was my second attempt at designing and conducting an experiment in a group setting, yet my first time analyzing and writing the results. I found this a stressful experience. I believe I felt pressure because it was my second time trying to complete the project, and it was heavily weighted. However, I also discovered the project significantly easier than anticipated, and even enjoyable in parts, such as creating vignettes or learning about my chosen DV. I felt more confident on the second attempt due to familiarity with each section of the process. What alleviated my stress were staying organized and being early for each phase since I naturally take longer than others with certain aspects of work. The best parts of the project were the group I was in. All members were productive and interactive, so I never felt overwhelmed with work. We frequently met up to discuss the experiment outside of lab and had an active WhatsApp group. It was beneficial having a group to rely on when confused, and in return, I helped out the other members as well. We all chose similar DVs for this purpose, enabling us to share our favorite research articles. I understand that my experience was unusual. I believe that the group dynamic I received was partly due to luck but also because we communicated frequently and effectively. In a future project, I would choose to work with this group again as we were highly productive together, completing each section quickly. Initially, we had the opportunity to perform a within-subjects design (which meant we would need only around 30 participants), but decided because we were all very motivated to do a between groups design, which we believed would be more meaningful. I took an extended time to write up the dissertation, starting in the first term, and working on it consistently for a few hours every week until the deadline. I often underestimate how long it takes me to draft. However, this method does allow me enough time for each section, and I never felt rushed. I am satisfied with the final result, and hopefully, the grade will reflect the effort I put in. In conclusion, this assignment taught me a lot. Although the experience was stressful, I believe this is partly due to my personality and because any new endeavor with a deadline will be stressful. I made some good friends during this process and enjoyed certain sections. The most challenging part was writing up; however, I hope the work I put in this time will make it easier for the next one.

Technical Skills & Attitude towards Research,1,0.8209,"This process has taught me much about data collection and research. The sample within this research was not as large as initially thought due to people not completing the study or answering no to consent questions. In future, I will aim to place my research on platforms and encourage more participation. An unforeseen challenge was overthinking all possible confounding variables; however, this reduced the generalizability of certain elements of the research. For future reference, I will weigh up the generalizability of the study against confounding variables and possibly learn when to prioritize one over the other. Positives I have gained from this research include increased confidence in SPSS and a deeper understanding of literature. Initially skeptical about using SPSS, working with my own data set allowed me to experiment, fail at many statistical elements before settling on estimated marginal means with the 2x2 ANOVA A. Additionally, employing a broad scope of research enabled me to analyze it in ways I had not previously considered. It is acceptable for research to contradict what one is trying to find and view this as positive; finding research that contradicted my findings allowed me to generate new discussions and areas for future research. Originally, I believed that non-significant results did not inform the researcher as much as significant results, however, I now recognize this as incorrect. Non-significant results from my research have helped me understand how they point research in a new direction and do not indicate that the research was a waste of time. I enjoyed learning about my perspective on research and considering its real-world implications for the judicial system.

We often missed one or two members during lab sessions, some of which were due to my illness throughout the school year. Playing catch-up was tiring. The common excuse of time management did not apply to me since I had and still have a very time-consuming extracurricular; there simply wasn't enough time in general to manage.
