"This mini-dissertation project was both rewarding and challenging, offering valuable insights into the research process and personal growth. Initially, the prospect of conducting an experiment with friends was exhilarating. The opportunity to independently investigate a topic made me feel like a PhD student embarking on an exciting academic journey. However, I quickly realized that effective teamwork requires more than simply dividing roles within a group. Successful collaboration involves understanding the unique working styles, communication preferences, and pacing of team members. While adapting to these differences proved challenging at times, the shared stress of the project ultimately brought us closer together. It revealed the true personalities of my teammates - who are also my friends - and highlighted their helpfulness and consideration during moments when I faced personal challenges. This project significantly enhanced my technical skills, particularly in using SPSS and conducting ANOVA analyses. Although I encountered setbacks, including having to redo the entire project to ensure variable differentiation within the team, these obstacles strengthened my resilience and problem-solving abilities. Balancing academic pressures alongside part-time work, family responsibilities, and Ramadan was overwhelming at times, but the support and guidance from my team members helped me persevere. Ultimately, this experience has been instrumental in shaping me as a future researcher. It has taught me to critically evaluate my own work and approach research papers with a more analytical perspective. The skills I have developed throughout this project will undoubtedly prove invaluable as I progress into my third year and undertake my dissertation.","This mini-dissertation project was both rewarding and challenging, offering valuable insights into the research process and personal growth.

"Initially I believed that working in a group who did not know me at all would be incredibly daunting and overwhelming however after the first week, I felt much more comfortable working as a group as they were forgiving and patient with me submitting ideas and potential solutions to issues and roadblocks. However, that is not to say it was flawless as a lot of jargon and technical info such as data analysis went over all our heads, and we had no idea collectively how to approach these issues. At first, data analysis was overbearing with it always being in the back of my mind with no conceivable way on how to approach it or conduct it and I pushed it back throughout the entire dissertation process, ignoring it until last minute which really halted progress and forced me to learn how to conduct it in SPSS. Even throughout the analysis I was holding onto the chance the analysis was wrong, and I did everything I could to make sure it was not, so I made too many stats in the end which were not added to the dissertation or open materials. Finally, designing and running the group Qualtrics survey and figuring out how to port it to excel and edit all the unimportant data really taught me a valuable lesson that psychological research is not instant or simple going into it, even coming out of it, the tasks are still daunting and soul-crushing looking back on it but now I can say I achieved what I set out to do with my group and we all performed as well as we could have done together. Not only has this survey taught me about the hardships of running a study but also how inconsistent the collection is as everyone will have different answers, some will answer the question wrong or misinterpret what the question says, giving vague answers or only answering with 'not sure/prefer not to say' for most questions. This ultimately made me feel more at ease when I participate in surveys because I know I'm not going to answer correctly but I now have the knowledge the researcher just wants the data. Overall, the mini-dissertation has made me a lot more confident in approaching the third-year dissertation by being more outgoing with my design and potentially working with multiple collaborators for advice and assistance as well as going more in depth on a topic than initially intended.","Initially, I believed that working in a group I did not know would be incredibly daunting and overwhelming.

"Overall, my experience with this dissertation was quite challenging and at times frustrating. While it was nice to work as a team for a change and share ideas regarding the research and study setup, the process was often hindered by one group member's frequent absence. This made the dissertation feel more like a two-person project, and having an extra, more engaged member might have made the experience run much more smoothly. A major issue throughout was the lack of communication outside of our lab sessions, which is something we all could have improved upon. Since we rarely interacted beyond those two hours, it was often difficult to stay on the same page. A good example of this miscommunication occurred over the Christmas break when we had planned to help each other with the Ethics Submission documents. However, when it came to the information sheet, we were left in the dark and had to create one ourselves, only to later discover that the absent group member had made their own version without informing us. Additionally, there were times when I asked questions and received no response from my fellow researchers, which made aspects of the project even more difficult. Another significant challenge was my experience with SPSS. For most of the year, I was unable to access the software, and even when I resolved the issue, there were instances where SPSS would not seem to generate data. This was incredibly frustrating, but in the end, it was a huge relief when everything finally worked as expected. Despite these challenges, I found our lab teacher to be incredibly helpful throughout the process as they supported our ideas, encouraged us, and told us what needed to be done to overcome any problems we may face. Their guidance made a significant difference, especially with regards to the Impact of Nicotine Withdrawal and Anhedonia when we struggled to understand certain aspects of the study or needed clarification on our methodology. Their support helped bridge some of the gaps caused by the lack of team communication, and I really appreciated their patience and expertise. While this experience had its difficulties, it has given me a clearer understanding of the research process and the importance of effective teamwork. Despite the frustrations faced from this mini dissertation, I am still looking forward to investigating my third-year dissertation independently, where I can take full control of my research and be better organized when it comes to setting up my research.","Overall, my experience with this dissertation was quite challenging and at times frustrating.

"At the start of this project, I was genuinely excited. I wanted to showcase my project management skills, generate and share ideas diplomatically, and work well with others. As the project progressed, I felt confused about the delivery side, particularly because the module leader inspired me at the beginning of the year. Balancing communication, mental health, physical health, and time management was tough, and learning how to handle data technically felt overwhelming. I didn't even know how to extend a column in Excel at the beginning, which made working with the messy dataset even more stressful. Although lab sessions provided clear guidance on running and formatting analyses, applying those instructions independently was harder than expected. With poor computer literacy, learning technical skills without direct support was a challenge throughout the project. Despite all that, I am genuinely proud of pulling this report together - especially learning how to export, clean, and manage data properly, which seemed beyond me at the start. I improved my practical research skills in unexpected ways. If I could change anything, it would be designing a study that made more sense for analysis, instead of choosing something quick and easy to get responses for. I would also advise myself to plan difficult steps carefully, seek clarification earlier, and not guess what was involved in working with data vaguely. This project challenged me more than anticipated, but it made me stronger and more confident for future research projects like my dissertation; because even though it takes me a little (a lot) longer to do data analysis, I can actually do it!","At the start of this project, I was genuinely excited.

"This project's decision-making demonstrated the impact of planning and flexibility on outcomes. Goals were established for sociability, academic performance, and belonging. My hypothesis suggested that sociability would influence belongingness more than academic success. The project encountered challenges, primarily in the literature review stage. Prior studies had linked sociability and belonging. A broader research focus was necessary. After reviewing literature and findings, it became clear that numerous social, environmental, and individual factors might impact belongingness, which the research design could not fully account for. Instead, sociability and academic success predicted belongingness. Consequently, I altered my study topic to better analyze the data. Data analysis proved challenging. Interpreting 2x2 ANOVA results without significant effects was difficult. I attempted to reconcile the lack of relevance with evidence supporting the importance of sociability. After further contemplation, I recognized these findings might necessitate a deeper understanding of belongingness and personal and institutional issues. At one point, I considered giving up. However, study technique, data processing, and adaptability helped me navigate unexpected results. Next year, I am more confident in my hypotheses, critical research skills, and adaptability. This experience underscored the complexity of academic research.","This project's decision-making demonstrated the impact of planning and flexibility on outcomes.

"From the start of the year, being told that I would be responsible for creating an original experiment and reporting it was certainly daunting given my relative lack of experience in academic writing, study skills, and utilising statistics packages. Working in my lab group greatly bolstered my ability to learn these concepts with the support of my lab partners, who were there every step of the way to answer questions and learn new concepts. I was able to learn the end-to-end process of an ethics application, including vetting questionnaires and identifying ethical concerns. The labs and lab tutor played a significant role in my development as a student and researcher, enabling me to think freely and work under my own power, with the support and guidance of an experienced tutor to prevent me from making serious mistakes. The lectures provided valuable insight and assisted me in setting a timeline for the creation of this mini-dissertation, helping me understand the theory behind different aspects of open research and analysis.

"I found conducting this research challenging. As I have analyzed research before in a lab-report format, I expected to struggle less. There were features of designing and conducting a study, such as using Qualtrics and obtaining participants, which were more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated. In hindsight, I wish I had familiarized myself with Qualtrics earlier and taken measures to ensure an even distribution of participants between conditions.

I dealt well with the additional struggles of being in a group with only one other person instead of three; this made the workload much larger, particularly as I had to assist my lab partner in areas they found difficult, such as SPSS. When working with others in the future, I will try to be more firm about ensuring the workload is evenly distributed and communicate more openly with the people I am working with.

This would have given me additional time to enhance my study's design, obtain a larger sample size, and improve materials by recording a video instead of using a written vignette. I also struggled to narrow the scope of my research. My interest in ASD led me to cover many areas within my lab report such as the double empathy problem, the issue of misdiagnosis in women, and issues with previous research. This led to exceeding the word count by double, meaning I had to cut much of my content, making this assignment take longer and submitting it close to the deadline.

For future projects, I will focus more on planning and considering which topics I will cover ahead of time and approximating how many words I will use in each section. Despite these challenges, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this project. The topic is of great interest to me, and although it was challenging, designing my study was also fun. It gave me a greater understanding of an issue which interested me and gave me insight into the process of being a researcher.","I found conducting this research challenging as I struggled more than anticipated with designing and conducting a study, particularly using Qualtrics and obtaining participants.

"Conducting this experiment was a challenging yet rewarding experience that taught me a lot about the research process. One of the most important lessons I learned was the importance of choosing the right measures. In hindsight, I should have used a mood survey that assessed general mood, not mood in the moment. As the survey only captured how participants were feeling at that exact time, it likely missed patterns in their usual emotional state, which may have affected the results. Recruiting participants went better than expected, and I was pleased to meet the sample size needed for analysis.

"Working as a group has always been a mixed experience for me, often involving highly engaged members and those who contribute less. At the start of our project, the group dynamic lacked cohesion, with only a few members actively participating while others either worked independently without communicating or remained largely disengaged. This lack of coordination at times left some of us unaware of the project's progress, making collaboration more difficult. However, as the project developed, our collaboration improved and became more effective. Despite these initial difficulties, I found the experience enjoyable because we had the autonomy to explore a topic that genuinely interested us all. One key difficulty we encountered was the complexity of our research design. Our enthusiasm led us to include multiple variables, which made the study unnecessarily complicated. This resulted in confusion during data analysis, especially when trying to identify relationships between the variables. Reflecting on this, I acknowledge the importance of selecting a clear and focused research question with a manageable design for future projects, particularly my final-year dissertation, to avoid unnecessary complexity in data analysis. Data analysis proved to be a significant challenge as interpreting Qualtrics data and navigating SPSS initially felt overwhelming. Despite receiving guidance from group members and my lab tutor, I struggled to grasp certain concepts. However, this struggle motivated me to refine my research skills, and while I continue to find some aspects challenging, this experience strengthened my confidence in data analysis. Moving forward, I plan to dedicate time to improving my proficiency in SPSS and statistical analysis in preparation for my final-year dissertation. Additionally, we faced challenges related to our study's small sample size, which limited the reliability of our findings. This issue was compounded by difficulties in recruiting enough participants. In future research, I would ensure a more extensive recruitment strategy to increase the sample size and improve data quality. Another issue we encountered was the length of our study, which led to participant fatigue. Many participants did not complete the full study, resulting in missing data and limiting our ability to perform a comprehensive analysis. This underscored the importance of designing a study that is engaging yet concise to maximize participant retention. Despite these challenges, the research process significantly enhanced my understanding of common research issues such as poor measure selection, small sample sizes, and participant dropout, and their impact on the interpretation of findings. I have come to recognize that psychological research is inherently uncertain and relies on statistical inference rather than definitive conclusions. Ultimately, completing this mini-dissertation has boosted my confidence in pursuing my final-year dissertation. I now feel better equipped to develop a clear research question, choose appropriate measures, and analyze data using SPSS. More importantly, I have gained the confidence to conduct research on a topic I am passionate about, ensuring that my dissertation will be both meaningful and well-structured.","Working as a group has always been a mixed experience for me, often involving highly engaged members and those who contribute less.

"Completing this mini-dissertation was both a challenging and rewarding experience. At the outset, I was intrigued by the idea that subtle communication cues - such as a speaker's title or use of medical jargon - could influence how individuals perceive their own health. Designing a 2x2 factorial experiment allowed me to explore this in a structured, empirical way. However, transforming an abstract idea into a fully realized study required constant critical thinking, organization, and attention to detail. One of the most valuable aspects of this project was learning how to operationalize variables, particularly self-rated health (SRH). Adapting items from the SF-36 survey and reverse coding them taught me about the importance of handling measurement tools carefully to ensure validity. Writing the Methods and Results sections helped solidify my understanding of statistical testing, especially two-way ANOVA, and the importance of power analysis. I also gained experience navigating Qualtrics for randomisation and survey design. Perhaps the most significant growth came during the Discussion section, where I had to critically evaluate my findings, acknowledge limitations, and consider future directions. While my hypotheses were only partially supported, this taught me that null or unexpected results are still meaningful and can inform theory and practice. Overall, this project deepened my understanding of how psychology research is conducted and the importance of methodological transparency. It also reinforced my ability to manage anxiety under pressure, work independently, and persevere through complex tasks - skills I will carry forward in my academic and professional journey.","Completing this mini-dissertation was both a challenging and rewarding experience.

"As I approach the conclusion of this module and project, I feel a blend of satisfaction and the weight of the substantial workload. Choosing our topic was particularly challenging, as we were determined to narrow it down to a specific niche that resonated with all team members. Forensic psychology stood out as an area of deep interest, especially in critiquing current investigative methods. Through an extensive review of the literature, we discovered that criminal profiling is often regarded as an outdated or abandoned technique. This realization fueled our curiosity about the cognitive mechanisms involved in suspect identification â specifically, how individuals rely on superficial cues, contextual information, and whether implicit biases distort judgment due to profiling's reliance on subjective interpretation rather than objective, empirical evidence. One of the most difficult aspects of this project was the word limit, which often felt restrictive. I struggled to balance depth and breadth, as certain areas warranted further exploration to construct a more comprehensive and nuanced argument. This challenge required careful refinement to ensure clarity and coherence without sacrificing critical insights. Throughout the process, I continuously adjusted my approach based on both feedback and self-reflection. Initially, my methodology was too broad, so I refined it for a more precise and targeted analysis. Additionally, when some sources did not align with my expectations, I had to reassess my interpretations to maintain analytical consistency. Looking ahead, I feel both eager and determined. This project has taught me valuable time management skills and how to think critically about my research approach. I look forward to applying these skills to future assignments and continuing to refine my academic work.","As I approach the conclusion of this module and project, I feel a blend of satisfaction and the weight of the substantial workload.

"This project started out feeling slow, particularly as one desires immediate progress with conducting/making. Patience with the team was valued, especially at the beginning. As we progressed, I enjoyed the creative aspect of designing an experiment with various variables and then implementing it in our survey, which was a satisfying process to reflect upon. I felt fortunate to work with a group sharing similar work ethic and mindset about the overall process, creating a smooth working environment with free-flowing ideas, mutual respect, and inspiration. They further motivated me, especially during occasional periods of apathy. Initially, I found an overwhelming amount of reading involved, and I was unsure where to begin.

"My research focused on the relationship between gender and personality's influence on conformity among individuals. Peer influence on group conformity was of particular interest to me. Based on prior research, I anticipated finding that more conscientious individuals, especially females, would exhibit higher levels of conformity compared to their less conscientious counterparts and males.

During this project, the SPSS analysis presented a challenge due to unexpectedly prolonged time requirements for result gathering, leaving me with reduced time for analysis. This led to feelings of anxiety primarily stemming from my unfamiliarity with SPSS. To overcome these challenges, I broke the process down into smaller sections and took the necessary time to better comprehend it.

This assignment proved difficult due to collaborative group work, as trusting peers to complete assigned tasks was challenging for me. However, this experience helped me grow as a student by fostering my skills in research-based projects that will be beneficial for my dissertation next year.","My research explored the relationship between gender and personality's impact on conformity among individuals, with a focus on peer influence on group conformity.

"Through this project, I have learned much about how to conduct research. Initially, I found myself overwhelmed with the freedom of choice, but talking through my ideas with others helped me narrow my choices down. Additionally, I struggled with finding research due to a lack of skills in using search engines and using the correct terms. One example was that I was too specific in my terms, using 'neuroticism' instead of 'personality.' This led me to improve my skills in this area. Moreover, when making the study, I had to think about how I wanted to measure and make compromises with my group members regarding participant engagement. This was a big challenge as I did not want anyone to feel they had to give up what they wanted to do. I also needed to improve my organizational skills to accommodate for others. All this has led me to improve my decision-making abilities, taking all factors affecting the decision into account.

   The study only had a small unrepresentative sample due to my lack of knowledge about gathering participants and keeping them interested enough to complete the questionnaire entirely. Next time, I will have to take a more active role in gathering participants as I do not think that I had tried as much as I should have. I struggled with analyzing the data I collected, which I had to redo multiple times. However, following from this and eventually completing it has given me much more confidence in my ability to understand, analyze, and derive meaningful conclusions from data and statistics.

   If asked to do something like this project again, I would have the knowledge and ability to complete it well.","Through this project, I have learned much about how to conduct research.

"Throughout the decision-making process, I learned the value of compromise and collaboration. There were times when I had to make sacrifices for group cohesion, and this taught me a valuable lesson: never to overvalue my own perspective above others. Everyone brings their own passion and reasoning to the table, and I've learned to give others' ideas the same energy and consideration I give my own. One of the main challenges we faced as a group was the difference in priorities, motivation, and discipline when it came to data collection and completing the project. Realistically, only two of us fully contributed, which made the workload unfairly distributed. This was frustrating at times, but it taught me a lot about leadership, patience, and accountability. Another significant challenge was the lack of a reliable structure within the university. The system often felt inconsistent and unclear, with different tutors and lecturers offering conflicting information. It was difficult to feel confident in the direction we were taking, especially when guidance varied so widely. Additionally, there seemed to be an imbalance in support - some students had access to module leaders, while others were assigned to fellows who, though well-meaning, often couldn't provide definitive answers. This created an uneven playing field and made it harder to feel confident in our work. We had to make several adjustments during the project, such as introducing a control variable and increasing the number of scenarios, which required flexibility and extra time that wasn't always easy to find under these conditions. At the point of submission, I feel uneasy. There are still aspects of the project that remain unclear, and I worry that by the time proper help arrives, it'll be too late. It's difficult to work within a system that doesn't always function as it should. Looking ahead to next year, I feel nervous. Working closely with a professor is something I'm expected to do, but based on my experience so far, I worry that I'll encounter the same lack of structure and support. In all honesty, I would prefer to work independently - at least that way, the outcome is fully in my hands, and I'm not left waiting on a system or individuals that aren't consistent. Still, I'm hopeful that with the lessons I've learned this year, I'll be able to navigate future challenges with more resilience and clarity.","Throughout the decision-making process, I learned the value of compromise and collaboration.

"Embarking on my first live research project has been a transformative and enlightening experience, offering valuable lessons that will shape my approach to academic work. From conceptualizing the research question through to data analysis and final write-up, each stage provided crucial insights. The initial challenge was bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. Navigating the complexities of research design, such as creating crime vignettes and ensuring unbiased framing, underscored the importance of precision, careful planning, and applying prior literature. This experience honed my critical thinking skills and emphasized adaptability when facing unexpected challenges.

   The project allowed me to refine my ability to develop a clear, well-supported rationale for every decision made during the process of psychological research. This highlighted the importance of thoughtful decision-making in designing experiments, selecting methods, and interpreting results. Every choice must be grounded in theory and evidence, ensuring robust research designs and valid conclusions. Developing this rationale strengthened my ability to justify methodological decisions, especially when competing theories or strategies were presented.

   As I move into my third year and begin planning my dissertation, I now understand the complexities involved in psychological research. I acknowledge that it is a fluid process requiring constant iteration, flexibility, and critical thinking. The skills developed, such as designing valid methods for investigating a research question, interpreting data, and communicating results effectively, will be invaluable in my future academic journey.

   Most importantly, this experience taught me to approach research with genuine intellectual curiosity and openness to new insights, knowing that the path from hypothesis to conclusion is rarely straightforward but always rewarding.

"During this time, I designed, composed, and completed my experiment and mini-dissertation. Many decisions needed to be made, such as choosing IV and DV, which was difficult due to differing opinions. We eventually chose one idea each that fit into similar categories. My choice was attachment style, intriguing and suitable for studying alongside relationship satisfaction and impulsivity. We chose a questionnaire because it was straightforward and easy for analysis but preprocessing the data proved complex with vast amounts requiring coding and conversion into meaningful data plots. Deciding what to include and exclude presented challenges.

   The ethical approval process posed difficulties, with many sends back and rejects before approval. We had to keep making small changes to the design and variables to gain approval. Errors in the questionnaire design after publishing caused processing and translating issues, leading to adjustments within data analysis like reverse coding the data, adding different representatives, using means, and discluding certain data that would have hindered processing and study results.

"Initially, the concept of producing my own research seemed incredibly daunting and unachievable. I found starting a group project and writing the lab report independently confusing and it seemed like an intense amount of work to complete individually. However, members of the group did not attend a large percentage of the lab sessions and did not contribute equally when designing the study and making resources. This experience taught the importance of having reliable teammates and active communication between group members to minimize conflict and ensure an even distribution of work. Despite this, the other group members worked effectively together to meet deadlines. I found that although it was a significant workload, lab times and the internal deadlines recommended by lab tutors helped turn the work into manageable pieces that could be conducted in a lab session. Data analysis was intimidating at first; however, there was a significant sense of achievement within the group when we surpassed our expected number of participants and had a larger sample size to close the study. However, this created a new obstacle: an Excel spreadsheet over 100 rows long. It took a bit of trial and error, but with the help of our lab tutor and YouTube videos, we processed our data to the stage where we could run an ANOVA. This experience highlighted that making mistakes initially is okay and can often be reversed or remedied. It also showed how much just trying can teach you; although it took a few attempts, eventually, variables were transformed. This feeling of self-achievement was shortly replaced with disappointment as my results were not significant. It felt very disheartening and as if I had done something wrong or picked a bad PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOUR 15 topic. After a discussion with my lab tutor, I realized that non-significant results are still important. I feel this is an incredibly important realization for an aspiring psychologist. My research found a contradiction to previous research, although the analysis may have been non-significant; the contradiction is a significant contribution to the field. It is important to learn not to be disappointed by this. Ultimately, I now feel more confident with the idea of completing my own completely independent dissertation next year.

"It was honestly reassuring to be in a group with others who, like me, had a lot going on outside of university. We understood each other's time pressures and this helped keep us motivated, even if it also meant a fair bit of last-minute scrambling. That said, I learned a lot from that. I went in with some quite narrow ideas about how to measure things, and it wasn't until I was deep in the process that I realized I needed to shift gears, and kind of make the most of what I had. So while the final version came together (somewhat) in the end, it definitely felt like I was piecing things together in real time, rather than having a clear vision from the beginning.

"At the start of the year, even thinking about a mini dissertation was daunting. I felt unprepared. As we formed groups and brainstormed ideas, I originally felt worried that as a group, we wouldn't be able to come together and produce a piece of work that we were all proud of. However, the difficulty of this project brought our small group together, and we supported each other throughout the process. Throughout the process of picking a topic, allocating variables and interactions for us all to choose, and then getting started with the study formation, we began to work together much more seamlessly than when we started. Working in a group has taught me how to rely on others for parts I feel less confident in.

I felt unprepared. As we formed groups and brainstormed ideas, I originally felt worried that as a group, we wouldn't be able to come together and produce a piece of work that we were all proud of. However, the difficulty of this project brought our small group together, and we supported each other throughout the process. Throughout the process of picking a topic, allocating variables and interactions for us all to choose, and then getting started with the study formation, we began to work together much more seamlessly than when we started. Working in a group has taught me how to rely on others for parts I feel less confident in.

"At the beginning of this project, I was excited to explore gender differences in perception, particularly how gendered language shapes attitudes towards job roles. Initially, I had to adapt my original idea due to other team members focusing on similar areas. Despite being initially disappointed, I remained open-minded and embraced the opportunity to work in a team. I enjoyed working with my partner overall, but collaboration came with difficulties. One challenge was our disagreement over using visual stimuli; I wanted to present job ads within stereotypically masculine and feminine office spaces, but we couldn't agree on their appearance, resulting in a change of direction that delayed progress. A significant challenge for me was SPSS; I initially felt overwhelmed by it but grew more confident as time passed. Unfortunately, technical issues led to the loss of data outputs, preventing me from recreating graphs shown to Caroline. Although I'm proud of the work submitted, it's not as comprehensive as it could have been. Moving forward, I understand the importance of completing tasks ahead of deadlines and seeking help when things go wrong. The project has highlighted the significance of visual and language-based framing in gendered communication, especially within marketing. In future projects, especially my final-year dissertation, I'd like to explore topics that integrate academic interests with professional fields, focusing on the power of gendered words and improving my ability to create engaging experimental materials reflective of real-world applications. Although this project may not be the piece I'm most proud of, it served as a turning point in my perception of myself as a researcher, providing clarity on values, voice, and future explorations. At submission, I feel a mix of pride, frustration, and relief but primarily motivated for what comes next.","At the beginning of this project, I was excited to explore gender differences in perception, particularly how gendered language shapes attitudes towards job roles.

"I was extremely excited to complete a mini-dissertation, however, I was skeptical about doing it as a group. Past experiences working in groups didn't give me much confidence; however, as the weeks went by, I realized I could rely on them. There were some weeks where motivation to come into labs decreased and most of us, including myself, didn't attend. If I was to do another group project again, I would take more advantage of the resources and support from the labs because towards the end, I found myself getting confused on analyzing data using SPSS. However, even though obtaining the statistical data seemed impossible towards the end, I managed to push through. With trial and error, it took me a full day to figure it out, but nonetheless, I'm proud that I persevered. Now, I can use SPSS with more confidence than before, and it doesn't seem as overwhelming as before. Ultimately, completing this mini-dissertation has been challenging but also rewarding. The process of conducting research and writing a substantial piece of work has significantly enhanced my understanding of factors affecting prosocial behavior and my overall academic skills. This opportunity has prepared me for how demanding my dissertation will be next year and put me in a great spot for what to expect.","I was extremely excited to complete a mini-dissertation; however, I was skeptical about doing it as a group.

"Creating a mini-dissertation study captivated me, fostering personal growth. This experience honed my teamworking and leadership skills. Though I anticipated challenges, I felt at ease as creating a study entails its difficulties. Choosing a complex topic, namely menstrual cycle, was exhilarating as it's a personal aspect I understand. My tranquility stemmed from the data I had accumulated on this subject through essays, critical proposals, and social interactions. I rehearsed my plan with George in labs, but acquiring participants, particularly females, proved challenging. This experience expanded my comprehension of participant recruitment and efficient data gathering, as building a study is not simple. Deciphering 2x2 data was intriguing yet demanding. Ultimately, my application of menstrual cycle encapsulated key insights regarding a female's period impact on working memory. In the process, I mastered technical content, especially using SPSS, an intimidating yet enjoyable experience. Moving forward, I will prioritize recruiting more participants and preparing for potential errors. I learned how to conduct my own study and am personally satisfied with the outcome; however, in the future, I aim to strengthen my approaches by avoiding failures and valuing eligibility criteria for further research.","Creating a mini-dissertation study captivated me, fostering personal growth.

"This mini-dissertation project offered valuable insights into the research process, particularly regarding the challenges and adaptations essential for designing and conducting independent studies. Initially, our team designed a complex study examining the relationship between anxiety through a GAD-7 questionnaire, stress, exposure to anxiety-inducing stimuli (comparing cute dog videos versus stressful tasks), and subsequent sleep quality (to be measured through a two-part questionnaire completed before and after sleep). However, we encountered several significant methodological challenges that prompted us to rethink our approach. The primary issues included substantial participant attrition for the second part of the questionnaire. Although we had a reasonable number of participants to complete the initial anxiety assessment, fewer than half continued with completing the sleep quality follow-up questionnaire. Additionally, concerning signs were noted on the validity of the data collected - as the majority who completed both questionnaire parts did so within an unreasonably short timeframe (in less than 30 minutes from the start time to submission) rather than the originally expected overnight period from 6-12 hours. This pattern suggested participants were completing both sections in a single sitting, invalidating our attempt to measure the post-sleep effects. These challenges call for the pivotal need to anticipate participant behavior cautiously and implement follow-up mechanisms accordingly, such as sending morning reminder emails (a measure which we had discussed during planning but eventually dismissed due to technical constraints). As a result of these obstacles, I have changed the current study design examining gender and ethnicity effects on anxiety, in a less procedurally complex way which still addresses meaningful psychological questions. This experience has given me valuable takeaways about research design, and the importance of striking the balance between ambitious methodology and practical feasibility. As a result of this study, I will bear in mind several crucial considerations when I undertake my third-year dissertation. First, sample representativeness relies significantly on participant recruitment strategies. Our reliance on university forums and group chats resulted in a demographically skewed sample, limiting generalisability. Second, more advanced project management skills will be highly essential for an 8,000-word project, in terms of planning project deliverables along the timeline of milestones. Through studying exemplary papers, I have also enhanced my academic writing skills in presenting the results and discussion sections. I found this learning process both enlightening and rewarding.

"During the mini-dissertation process, the most challenging aspect was deciding on a research topic due to the freedom we had in choosing one. We had several ideas, but found it difficult to incorporate all topics into one. After making compromises and reaching a decision, our ideas started flowing better. When designing the research, we had some existing ideas from past papers that we incorporated into our design; however, looking back now, an experimental measure could have been used for one of our independent variables. In data collection, we found it tricky as most participants completed only the first half of the survey, neglecting the second half about their sleep the morning after. Therefore, we should have made it clearer for participants to complete the whole survey and provided prompts as they went along. During the analysis part of the research, I initially found it confusing but then got the hang of it by ensuring all parts of the analysis were included in my results. Overall, this experience will greatly benefit me next year as I will know what to expect when conducting my own research and have better ideas for my future work.","During the mini-dissertation process, the most challenging aspect was deciding on a research topic due to the freedom we had in choosing one.

"The mini-dissertation process presented several challenges, primarily due to the group work involved. The members of our group did not know each other personally before starting the project, and since we were all introverts, building rapport and establishing a common purpose proved difficult. Initially, we struggled with social engagement, which led us to adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy for collaboration. However, as time went on, we began to support each other and work together more effectively. One significant challenge was that our group was larger than others, making it harder to design a cohesive study as we all needed to focus on the same aspect. Additionally, at the start of the process, we lacked a solid understanding of 2x2 ANOVA, which caused some confusion among us. A pivotal moment for me occurred when I missed one of the lab sessions, during which crucial design changes were made without my input. In my absence, other members took on the main effects, leaving me with the focus on interactions, as our tutor had initially suggested. However, once data collection concluded, our tutor recommended that I swap one of the independent variables with one of the dependent variables to enhance clarity. This placed me in a challenging situation, as I had not been involved in selecting or applying the survey relevant to that part of the project. Consequently, I found myself analyzing a design in which I had only been partially involved. From this experience, I learned that designing a study is the most critical aspect of the process and that a divide-and-conquer approach is not the best way to manage group work. If I could go back, I would choose to be more involved in every part of the project from the beginning. Despite these challenges, I feel good about my submission, and I feel even better about the next year's project as I have learned a lot. I have already selected my project topic and met with my supervisor, who has agreed with my proposal. I am eager to conduct research on my chosen subject and am filled with curiosity about it.

"Completing this mini-dissertation project has been a valuable and enriching experience for my psychology study journey. I enjoyed the entire process, especially data analysis and writing the report. Although the topic was not one I would have chosen (proposed by another team member), it provided me with a great deal of learning. It made me reflect on my own thinking, as I may sometimes rely on unconscious stereotypes. This project deepened my understanding of how easily people use mental shortcuts, such as race as a salient heuristic, when making judgments, especially in a media-saturated world where unverified narratives can shape perceptions. Beyond the theoretical learning, this project offered me the chance to practice essential research skills, from ethical planning and survey design to data analysis and writing up results. I genuinely enjoyed the process and often found myself immersed in the role of a researcher. It made me realize how much I enjoy working with real data and thinking critically about human behavior, which deepened my curiosity about psychological research and strengthened my desire to pursue this path further. Working with a team also reminded me that research is a collaborative process, and that social connection plays a vital role in learning and growth.

"This Mini Dissertation was a good experience for me. I was lucky to be part of a group with three other highly engaged and motivated people who shared my enthusiasm for the project. We were able to quickly form a strong bond and effectively collaborate to generate ideas, support one another, and manage our workload efficiently. Our ability to coordinate meetings and discussions ensured that everyone stayed informed, even when one of us couldn't attend a lab session. We made it a priority to keep each other updated which demonstrated the importance of teamwork and communication. I enjoyed working in a group, as when we first found out about the Ethics application, I was instantly overwhelmed with the workload, but we all worked together to submit it on time, making it less stressful. While we were told it might be difficult to get our target sample population, I was very proud of how efficiently we distributed our questionnaire and how quickly we gathered all the necessary responses. I found the templates on the VLE very useful for setting up a Qualtrics questionnaire and was surprised by how straightforward it was. However, I found the data analysis hard. Working with raw data in Excel was difficult for me due to my limited experience, but working with my team to analyze the data together made it manageable. The other thing I struggled with was interpreting the data from SPSS. As there were many tables SPPS provided, I found it hard to determine which were most relevant for the lab report, therefore the results section took longer to write. Despite these challenges, I enjoyed conducting my research. This experience has improved my confidence in research design, data collection, and statistical analysis, which will be useful for my third-year dissertation.

Completing this mini-dissertation—designing and executing it—enhanced my critical thinking and analytical skills. I now feel more confident in analyzing data, as being able to run it and check it against another individual using the same data made it simple to identify where I had gone wrong or overlooked missing variables.

"At first, the whole idea of carrying out a study and writing a 2500-word dissertation intimidated me. However, as we started to break down our steps from establishing what we would study to analyzing our data, it made the whole experience less stressful. Our group had excellent teamwork when constructing the study and carrying it out. However, there were times of absence of some group members when we were struggling with data analysis, and the remaining people stayed in after our lab session to understand and resolve our problem. Despite this, we resolved the difficulties we faced and met the deadline for this project. This has enabled me to understand the importance of collective responsibility. I have learnt that designing a study takes a lot of thought and consideration of all the variables and possible flaws in carrying out research. Furthermore, how hard it is to control these flaws, such as using a different measure to study which is also subject to having flaws. This has allowed me to understand how much consideration and thought is put into designing research. For me, the most difficult part of this experience was cleaning the data and running it through analysis. As a person who has rarely used Excel, it took a long time for me to interpret raw data, sum up the scores of all the participants, and put it in a separate Excel document. Furthermore, I found it difficult to run tests on SPSS, as this was a great weakness for me from year 1. The difficult part was computing each of the variables and how to run each test (such as the test of normality, marginal means, and more) as well as interpreting the data in my results section. However, as I got through this, it has made me more confident in using SPSS and analyzing data, providing me with important SPSS skills. This has given me more confidence for the final-year dissertation, so I will be more prepared for data analysis in conclusion, this mini-dissertation has provided me with insight into how I will be carrying out a study for our final-year dissertation and has made me feel more confident and experienced in tackling any problems I have, as well as carefully designing and analyzing my study.","At first, the whole idea of carrying out a study and writing a 2500-word dissertation intimidated me.

"Completing this Mini-Dissertation has been a valuable and rewarding learning experience. One of the aspects I enjoyed most was designing the study and selecting the research topic, specifically exploring the effects of sleep and breakfast consumption on working memory because I am genuinely passionate about how lifestyle behaviors influence cognitive performance. This helped me stay motivated and focused despite some challenges along the way. While group work had generally constructive moments, difficulties arose particularly around communication and attendance due in part to practical constraints including my own health challenges which occasionally impacted my participation in scheduled meetings. Nonetheless, we were able to effectively collaborate when it mattered, and I appreciated and enjoyed the opportunity to engage in collaborative work. Through this process, I have developed a deeper understanding of research and became more confident using SPSS, especially when running and interpreting ANOVA tests, checking assumptions, and reporting statistical findings in APA format. Learning how to bring together multiple sections of the dissertation â from literature review to analysis and discussion â has helped me build skills and confidence I will need for my final-year dissertation. If given the opportunity, I would have liked to explore additional measurement tools such as validated sleep or nutrition questionnaires which could enhance internal validity in future research. I also now appreciate the value of objective measures and a more diverse sample, intending to incorporate these into my final-year project. Overall, this experience has not only strengthened my research and analytical skills but has also clarified the areas of psychology I am most drawn to. I feel more prepared for the challenges of independent research in my final year and am excited to continue building on what I've learned.","Completing this Mini-Dissertation was a valuable and rewarding learning experience.

"When I was told I would conduct a study with people for my mini-dissertation, I was nervous. However, once I knew who I was working with, my nerves settled and it was smooth sailing. Using Qualtrics to create a survey was enjoyable as it allowed me to use technology skills. Trialing the survey before ethics review helped me to identify errors. I learned that a lot of time goes into coding and will start early if using Qualtrics next year. Finding a suitable questionnaire for variables assessed was interesting. The ethics application process was stressful but most people do not get approved on their first try, so I was prepared. Data cleaning was straightforward, my favorite part.

"Throughout this project, I have learned to be logical and patient among other things. My fascination with narcissism and the dark personality traits stemmed from first year when I explored manipulation for my extended essay. In this project, I got to test my own ideas in real life and get involved in exploring this dark side of personality. Thankfully, there were not many narcissists in our 2nd year labs; however, this was frustrating for data collection as it meant I had an extremely imbalanced sample and could not score the statements the usual way. This required problem-solving, and with the help of my lab tutor, we found a solution. Working in a team was another frustrating experience when trying to adapt a study for everyone; however, we made it work, and everyone collaborated with equal effort in the beginning to find middle ground. From this experience, I have learned that I value working with a team and sharing ideas, as some of the ideas I hadn't thought of. Even if some members stopped turning up, I think I could have made more of an effort to encourage them and give them reasons to keep making the effort they had initially. Furthermore, ANOVA was an accurate analysis to run; I feel confident in using this and would be happy to conduct an ANOVA again next year or explore something different. My biggest realization was that time management is essential - I started this project way in advance and did it in steps, which eased a lot of pressure and made it manageable. This allowed me to still enjoy the project throughout. For next year, I will be more confident using APA format, and this has been a great chance to put everything we have learned into real practice. As I submit, I feel overwhelmed with emotions - joy that it's complete but also sad that it is over as it has been such a journey.

"Looking back, my research journey didn't start smoothly. I was allocated a lab group whose interests revolved around conspiracy theories, which clashed with my academic goals. This was frustrating but taught me the importance of working with a team focused on genuine, evidence-based research. To build a strong foundation for our project, I dove into extensive research in my area of interest, reviewing existing studies to find gaps we could address. This helped us create a study relevant to Perception of Witness Credibility and well-structured. I came up with three potential study designs and invited my teammates to help decide which one to pursue, ensuring everyone felt included and invested in our project. Naturally, my strong understanding of the subject and motivation led me to take a leadership role during the planning phase. However, I faced the challenge of combining everyone's different ideas into a single, clear plan while maintaining scientific accuracy. The varying levels of knowledge among group members made collaboration tricky, and I often found myself guiding the direction of the study while keeping everyone engaged.

One major obstacle we encountered was the unexpectedly long duration of our study that caused many participants to drop out. They were hesitant to commit due to the lengthy nature of the study. Even though our randomization process went smoothly, the lower-than-expected participant numbers pushed me to step outside my comfort zone and actively recruit more participants around campus. This was challenging but ultimately boosted my confidence in promoting my research and reaching out to people.

Organizing the data we collected took a lot of effort, but once we sorted it out, analyzing it turned out to be a rewarding experience, revealing some interesting findings. I struggled with the urge to overanalyze the results, reminding myself of the importance of staying disciplined in interpreting data. This experience taught me how to design future studies more efficiently.

Working in a team presented its own set of challenges, especially since I usually prefer working alone. This project encouraged me to let go of some control and trust my teammates with different parts of the research. This was a key moment for my personal growth, as I learned to balance being a leader with collaborating with others.

I realized that my tendency to overwork and focus too much on small details sometimes slowed us down. I often created overly complicated data sheets that confused my teammates and required extra time to explain my thought process. This experience highlighted for me that keeping things simple can improve both efficiency and clarity in research.

The lessons I learned from this experience will be invaluable as I move on to my third-year dissertation and other future projects. I now have a deeper appreciation for collaborative research, effective data management, and the importance of clear study design. I'm excited to apply these insights to my upcoming work, ensuring that I maintain both scientific accuracy and practicality.","Looking back, my research journey didn't start smoothly.

"Completing this mini dissertation was a valuable yet challenging learning experience. One of the most difficult aspects for me was using SPSS. At the start, I found it overwhelming to navigate the software, label variables correctly, and interpret outputs. I often made mistakes when entering data or selecting the right tests, which initially affected my confidence.

"The mini-dissertation was a group project conducted during second year. In Term One, we designed an experiment for a 2x2 ANOVA, while in Term Two we executed the experiment and wrote the dissertation. It is essential to note that I previously attempted to complete the second year of this course but had to take a leave of absence due to health issues during the start of the second term. This was my second attempt at designing and conducting an experiment in a group setting, yet my first time analyzing and writing the results. I found this a stressful experience. I believe I felt pressure because it was my second time trying to complete the project, and it was heavily weighted. However, I also discovered the project significantly easier than anticipated, and even enjoyable in parts, such as creating vignettes or learning about my chosen DV. I felt more confident on the second attempt due to familiarity with each section of the process. What alleviated my stress were staying organized and being early for each phase since I naturally take longer than others with certain aspects of work. The best parts of the project were the group I was in. All members were productive and interactive, so I never felt overwhelmed with work. We frequently met up to discuss the experiment outside of lab and had an active WhatsApp group. It was beneficial having a group to rely on when confused, and in return, I helped out the other members as well. We all chose similar DVs for this purpose, enabling us to share our favorite research articles. I understand that my experience was unusual. I believe that the group dynamic I received was partly due to luck but also because we communicated frequently and effectively. In a future project, I would choose to work with this group again as we were highly productive together, completing each section quickly. Initially, we had the opportunity to perform a within-subjects design (which meant we would need only around 30 participants), but decided because we were all very motivated to do a between groups design, which we believed would be more meaningful. I took an extended time to write up the dissertation, starting in the first term, and working on it consistently for a few hours every week until the deadline. I often underestimate how long it takes me to draft. However, this method does allow me enough time for each section, and I never felt rushed. I am satisfied with the final result, and hopefully, the grade will reflect the effort I put in. In conclusion, this assignment taught me a lot. Although the experience was stressful, I believe this is partly due to my personality and because any new endeavor with a deadline will be stressful. I made some good friends during this process and enjoyed certain sections. The most challenging part was writing up; however, I hope the work I put in this time will make it easier for the next one. This was completed using the Gibbs (1988) reflective account model.","The mini-dissertation, a group project conducted during second year, designed an experiment for a 2x2 ANOVA in Term One and executed it in Term Two. It is important to note that I previously attempted this course but had to take a leave of absence due to health issues at the start of the second term; this was my second attempt at designing and conducting an experiment in a group setting, yet my first time analyzing and writing the results. I found this experience stressful. However, the project turned out to be easier than anticipated and even enjoyable, especially when creating vignettes or learning about my chosen DV. I felt more confident on the second attempt due to familiarity with each section of the process. Staying organized and being early for each phase alleviated my stress as I naturally take longer than others with certain aspects of work. The group was productive and interactive, so I never felt overwhelmed with work; we frequently met up to discuss the experiment outside of lab and had an active WhatsApp group. This was beneficial when confused, and in return, I helped out other members as well. We all chose similar DVs for this purpose, enabling us to share our favorite research articles.

"This mini-dissertation project was challenging yet rewarding. Research methods has consistently been my favorite module of the course due to its hands-on nature, which I prefer over the more bookish nature of other modules. The formula of writing lab reports is something I understand better than essay writing, and it also allows me to read and understand scientific journals outside of the course, a valuable skill I've learned during my university years.

   Our group project was an in-person experiment, which I enjoyed but makes me hesitant about conducting in-person studies next year due to the increased workload, time commitments, and difficulty in acquiring participants, resulting in less generated data. As a first-year student, most of the studies I completed for research credits were online studies, and this is likely the case for most first-year students. This isn't meant to be negative, but rather a consideration of what will yield the best results for my dissertation.

   If I find a topic I am deeply interested in that requires in-person experiments next year, I will gladly do it and be grateful for the experience gained this year. The analysis was one of the parts of the write-up that I struggled with more than expected, as we've only ever done simple analysis in the past, and this had a multitude of steps. While I understand it well enough in SPSS, when it comes to the results section, I can only hope I provided the correct information in the proper format.

   I also faced challenges finding resources on the VLE, but once found, they were extremely helpful with formatting, which I find extremely satisfying, albeit a bit nerdy.

   In conclusion, this project was challenging yet rewarding. I look forward to next year.","This mini-dissertation project was challenging yet rewarding.

"To have the opportunity to create a research project during our second year was extremely helpful, and I am very grateful as it has got me excited for next year's dissertation. Working in a group was extremely useful, as everybody was proactive and determined to create the best study we could. There were debates about creating the study, but nothing that created an awkward environment or wasn't immediately resolved, strengthening our work ethic. We had issues with creating independent and dependent variables at first, but with help from each other and our lab tutor, we overcame those difficulties. I particularly enjoyed using Gorilla software for this study, as it provided insight into what I can use next year for my research project. Although understanding the software was difficult initially, specifically the data collection spreadsheets, I quickly developed my understanding of the software and created an effective online study. The whole group contributed to creating the Gorilla study, so help was always available when needed. I also enjoyed the statistics side of psychology as I do not mind SPSS, making analysis successful, and brushing up on my skills made me more confident. Overall, this process was extremely fulfilling, and I enjoyed working with this group to create a study. This experience helped me identify my weaknesses and areas for improvement before third year, and I now know what was successful for me, which I can use when brainstorming for my dissertation project.","To have the opportunity to create a research project during our second year was extremely helpful, and I am very grateful as it has gotten me excited for next year's dissertation.

"From the beginning, the mini-dissertation group project, worth a high percentage, felt extremely daunting. This feeling decreased with time and experience. Having a group of 4 that I already have a close bond with helped massively as we understand each other well. From the get-go, we brainstormed many ideas and creativity flowed between us, meaning we created the fundamental ideas for this project quite early on. Despite this, I personally faced many challenges as my attendance began to fall a little due to illness and other personal aspects, but I tried my best to catch up and my group thoughtfully updated me and helped explain new additions to the plan that I may have missed out. As our mini-diss was an in-person experiment, we knew we had to recruit as many people as possible which took a lot of time, so we successfully distributed assigned roles to tackle the complexity and time-inducing aspect of this. Once majority of the data was collected and I began plotting my results and gathering my findings accordingly, I felt quickly overwhelmed. There were a lot of figures to work with and tension did begin to rise within the group as some were more stressed with working with SPSS than others. But this quickly resolved with some communication. Personally, I was confused with a few features of our experiment and how we had our own areas to work on, resulting in being frustrated with myself and my understanding as it seems like the others knew exactly what to do. I had many mixed emotions creating this investigation. There were moments I felt bored, however collecting varied ends of the spectrum results was interesting. I enjoyed the fact that participants themselves were really intrigued with the aims of the study and got stuck in which made me keener to continue the enthusiasm. I have felt a sense of accomplishment now completing this project with more confidence for next year.

"This process has taught me a lot about data collection and research. The sample within this research was not as large as initially thought. I didn't account for people not completing the whole study or answering no to consent questions. Moving forward, I will try to put my research on platforms and encourage more people to take part. Another unexpected challenge was overthinking all possible confounding variables. I wanted to control all potential influencing variables; however, this reduced the generalizability of certain elements of the research. For future reference, I will consider weighing up the generalizability of the study with confounding variables and maybe learn when to trade them off for each other.

Positives I have learnt from this research include newfound confidence in SPSS and a deep dive into literature. I was skeptical about using SPSS; however, working with my own data set allowed me to experiment, fail at many statistical elements, before settling on estimated marginal means with the 2x2 ANOVA A. Additionally, using a wide scope of research enabled me to analyze it in ways I had not before. It is okay for research to contradict what one is trying to find and see this as a positive. Finding research contradicting my findings allowed me to generate new discussions and areas for future research.

Originally, I thought that not significant results did not inform the researcher as much as significant results, however I now see this as incorrect. The not-significant results from my research have helped understand how it points research in a new direction and does not mean the research was a waste of time. I enjoyed learning about my views on research and considering the real-world impacts on the judicial system.

From the beginning, I was fortunate to have a group as passionate and determined as myself. Everyone was excited to conduct in-person research, making the whole process more enjoyable and engaging. I had a clear vision of my research topic from the first Research-Methods lecture, as I had explored it in my own previous studies. Through discussions with my supervisor and research group, we narrowed the focus to mindfulness meditation, making the whole project more manageable and effective long term. At first, we thought we were all researching the same topic together, so for a while, there was some minor confusion with our IVs and DVs but that was soon resolved. The other three members of my group focused on related topics such as mindfulness states during meditation and heart rate during the types of meditation, creating a collaborative atmosphere that motivated us all to dive deeper into our research. One challenge I encountered was analyzing and interpreting the data, but this taught me the importance of being flexible and adjusting interpretations when things do not go as planned. Originally, we had built a single-electrode EEG system to measure brain activity, but after facing difficulties, the decision was made to switch to measuring HRV. Though frustrating, this change happened early, allowing us to adapt quickly and keep moving forward. We spent two months in our experimental room, refining our methods and collecting data. Overall, this experience deepened my appreciation for empirical research and will shape how I approach future projects. For example, I was inspired to use quantitative data for my third-year dissertation as this process of collecting data was exciting.

"Overall, this was one of the most challenging assignments I have worked on in my life. From the beginning, the decision-making process was messy. Every week ideas were different from the last and none made sense. It felt impossible to comprehend the assignment, let alone make progress with it. What I learned during the first month of brainstorming is that it may be better to work with people who have some level of intelligence rather than those I am familiar with. Eventually, decisions were made and the process began of forming our experiment. During this stage, task delegation was difficult and there were teammates who did not pull their weight. I wish I could say I learned something about leadership here, but I actually lost respect for two of my previous friends due to their complete lack of will or motivation or even common decency and thoughtfulness towards the rest of the team members. After working through all the initial parts, we eventually made our survey; a task delegated to one team member. However, after putting it out, we realized that some questions had been mistyped. I learned that in the future, I should only trust myself to cross-check other people's work. From that point onwards, there was less teamwork and more duo work, and at this point, I feel disappointed because I believe this study could have been much better if we had a whole team of people who genuinely cared about doing well and maintaining integrity in their work.

"The initial stages of formulating my research question proved challenging as we collaboratively identified the broader topic of VR exposure therapy for public speaking anxiety but isolating my specific focus on motivation proved difficult. This difficulty extended to finding existing research that directly assessed motivation or its interaction with VR exposure therapy and anxiety reduction. This lack of direct precedent made it difficult to firmly establish my research question and independent variables from the outset, which deviated from established protocols, further complicated the process. In future, I will conduct more in-depth research prior to starting a project, ensuring a clear understanding of the research question and independent variables from the very beginning. Accessing VR equipment presented another hurdle due to limited availability and shared use with other research groups resulting in delays during data collection. For future projects, I will prioritize materials that are readily accessible to avoid similar delays.

   While ethical considerations were paramount, finding participants with a debilitating fear of public speaking proved difficult. The relaxed environment, privacy, and lack of time constraints might have contributed to this. Additionally, the VR app ""Ovation"", while engaging, may not have provided a sufficiently realistic experience. Many participants found the VR experience enjoyable rather than stressful, potentially impacting the severity of the exposure. In future research, I will consider including a control group to better determine if observed changes are truly due to the treatment. Furthermore, the reliance on self-report measures raises concerns about potential bias from placebo effects or participants' desire to present themselves favourably. A control group would help mitigate these concerns and enhance the reliability of the experiment.

   Analysing the data using SPSS proved to be the most challenging aspect of the project. My understanding of SPSS and statistics, while improving, still requires further development. The complexity of the study design and analyses pushed me to seek guidance from my lab tutor, take detailed notes, and utilise online resources. This experience highlighted the ongoing learning curve in data analysis and reinforced the need for continued practice.

   The experiment's design was strong, yielding significant results and exploring motivation, a relatively understudied area. Communication within the group was effective, particularly in coordinating data collection. However, communication with participants could have been improved. The complexity of the ""Ovation"" app, along with technical issues, led to misinterpretations and disruptions during the VR sessions. In future research, I will provide clearer instructions, potentially incorporating visual aids like picture demonstrations or videos.

   Despite the challenges, this research contributes to understanding the potential effectiveness of VR exposure therapy for anxiety reduction. My findings suggest that motivation may play a role even with less realistic VR experiences. Future research could build upon this by improving VR realism, incorporating a control group, and investigating different types of motivation. This experience has reinforced the importance of having access to reliable equipment, providing clear participant instructions, and developing statistical analysis skills for smooth and effective research. The difficulties encountered during this project pushed me to problem-solve, take initiative, and enhance my research and critical thinking skills.

"Completing this project allowed for me to understand the importance of leadership and effective teamwork, as well as deepening my comprehension of primary data collection and data processing and analyzing. While I usually prefer not to take charge during projects, due to an initial lack of cohesion within the group, I decided to take responsibility in organizing. This included completing the ethical approval, creating the online survey on Qualtrics, and distributing tasks within the group. Although I prefer not to take control, distributing tasks allowed for me to feel more comfortable in what was occurring. This experience, however, boosted my confidence in myself and has encouraged me to take leadership roles more often. Doing this project also improved my understanding of collecting primary data and using that data within SPSS, a process that seemed very daunting but I now understand to be very straightforward. Moreover, the importance of effective teamwork was also noted. While I was fortunate to have a hard-working group, I would have preferred to have a group that was more communicative since I found it difficult at times to fully understand what everyone was doing within their role. Not many adjustments were made during this study, personally because I initially felt very overwhelmed with the task, but reflecting on it now has made me realize the straightforward process that takes place and how next year, if an adjustment needs to be made then I will be able to do it. Challenges faced in this study primarily relied upon the lack of participants, and also silly mistakes that occurred due to a lack of critical thinking. The lack of participants, due to not enough promoting of the study, came with issues when collecting data since when calculating power calculations, to have a small effect size a much larger sample was needed, 16 BELONGINGNESS much more than 23. This leads me to understand the importance of promoting the study for the benefit of the findings. Silly mistakes occurred when failing to include extra questions within the survey, such as questions of gender, age and ethnicity, which could have provided more explanations of findings. They also occurred when altering established questionnaires. Without consulting my tutor, an alteration to a questionnaire resulted in data that had to be removed, further impacting the results by removing data from a study that was already lacking in it. Overall, completing this project was a very rewarding and gratifying experience as it provided me with first-hand experience within conducting experiments, and made me become familiar and comfortable with data collecting, processing and analyzing. The whole process, especially using SPSS, can be a very intimidating experience, and this project allowed for me to understand that it is not as difficult as it may first seem, not as difficult as recruiting participants. At submission, I felt proud and relieved that this seemingly impossible task was actually completed. Completing this project makes me feel confident for the process that will occur for my Dissertation in final year.","Completing this project allowed for understanding the importance of leadership and teamwork, deepening comprehension of primary data collection and analysis.

"Upon reflection, I think that one of the more challenging aspects of this project was deciding a topic for our research. With the nature of the project, we had free rein to choose our subject (within reason), and therefore narrowing down our ideas was tricky. However, once we discussed the idea of conformity, it became clear that it was the route we wanted to pursue. Over the following weeks, we also decided that we wanted to study the effects of personality and gender on conformity. We came up with our methodology fairly quickly; however, I wish we had spent more time considering how we wanted to measure conformity. Asch's line study is such a well-known study, and using this task left a lot of room for demand characteristics. Once our ethics was approved, we moved on and started to conduct our study. Initially, we wanted to have a group of 3 naive participants with confederates for each study; however, we adjusted this so that only one participant was in a group with the confederates. I found analyzing the data quite difficult, but I am happy that we had this year to have a 'run through,' as I now feel more confident in my ability to do it again on my own next year. Upon submission, I feel proud of myself and my group for conducting our first piece of research, and I will be sure to take these challenges from the research to better my dissertation next year.","Upon reflection, I think that one challenging aspect of this project was deciding a topic for our research.

"Conducting this study on gender and emotional valence in recognizing emotional intensity through eye contact has been an insightful journey. From developing the research question to analyzing data, I have gained a deeper appreciation for the complexities of nonverbal communication and emotional perception. One of the most surprising findings was the lack of significant main effects for gender and emotional valence, despite previous research suggesting otherwise. However, the significant interaction effect - where female participants showed greater accuracy in recognizing negative emotions - raised important questions about socialization processes and cognitive biases in emotion recognition. This encouraged me to critically assess existing theories and acknowledge the intricate nature of these psychological mechanisms. Methodologically, I became more aware of the trade-offs in experimental design. While static eye images provided control, they lacked real-world dynamism. Future research using videos or interactive stimuli could yield more ecologically valid insights. Additionally, the gender imbalance in my sample (34 males, 66 females) may have influenced the findings, highlighting the importance of balanced participant recruitment. Reflecting on broader implications, my study connects with practical fields like psychotherapy, education, and AI development. This experience has deepened my curiosity about emotion perception and inspired future research directions into cultural and personality-based influences.","Conducting this study on gender and emotional valence in recognizing emotional intensity through eye contact has been an insightful journey, from developing the research question to analyzing data.

"The project's initial phase was somewhat difficult due to an uneven number of students, resulting in a group of 5 instead of the usual 4 for a mini dissertation. This created confusion when implementing a 2 X 2 ANOVA and necessitated finding additional variables for the study. Once sorted, the project became more manageable as the group met internal deadlines easily with five members working concurrently on different sections. Communication within the group was relatively good due to frequent lab attendance and resolution of any arising issues. The experiences underscored the significance of effective communication and regular lab attendance in facilitating the mini dissertation process. Initially, data analysis seemed daunting, but proved simpler (apart from running the ANOVA) once grasped. The fear of analyzing 337 responses in Qualtrics was alleviated upon starting the task. However, challenges arose during the running of the ANOVA in SPSS due to some issues, which were addressed with tutor and peer assistance. This situation further emphasized the importance of communication and attendance, while enhancing research skills and SPSS proficiency for future projects. Ultimately, designing and conducting my own research substantially improved critical thinking skills.

At first, we relied on using videos of each witness to ensure gender and race were evident and visually taken in. However, we thought it would create confounding variables which could potentially affect results. Additionally, I soon realized during the survey people weren't going to focus on comprehending the description of the witness; instead, they would jump to the testimony itself. Eventually, we noticed faults in our work and reflected on them. Another challenge was creating the survey as I found it challenging getting to the answer of how to randomize our variables.

"Working on this mini-dissertation project taught valuable lessons such as the importance of spending ample time to find a key study for inspiration, focusing on implementing and recreating its methods and measures into our study. This became clear when I examined a few studies to gain a general idea of potential measurements, but had no solid direction. As a result, I settled on an idea that received minimal research (State anxiety from the STAI and order effects) related to PSA in VRE.

   In my quest for an anxiety measurement tool, I was unaware I only utilized half of the STAI, employing only the state anxiety aspect and neglecting the trait section - a realization that came halfway through the process, emphasizing the need for thorough research and careful planning.

   I also learned about the complexity of working within a group, as our study initially had a between design, which was later changed to a mixed design, and eventually reverted back into a between design at the last minute. Time constraints were prevalent due to other coursework obligations and limited availability of the VR headset due to sharing with another year group, reducing the number of collected participants.

   Despite these challenges, this was an enriching experience that highlighted areas requiring more dedicated time in future endeavors (research, experimentation, organization, planning, etc.).

"This project investigated the effects of gender and openness to experience on conformity, requiring a balance between relevance to theories and practicality. I chose openness as my personality trait due to its potential inverse relationship with conformity, a connection I discovered through literature. Operationalizing this trait within a controlled experiment proved challenging. We aimed for balanced gender representation, necessitating adjustments to recruitment strategies. Designing an effective task was another major challenge; it needed to extract levels of conformity while maintaining ethical standards. A pilot test with friends helped identify ambiguities, allowing us to make necessary revisions for clarity and consistency. Data analysis presented issues due to interpreting interaction effects with a small sample size, prompting deeper engagement with statistical issues.

"Completing this mini dissertation offered valuable insights into conducting a study, time management, and teamwork. The experience of practicing group research work alleviated initial third-year dissertation apprehensions, although the mini dissertation topic did not directly relate to potential third-year topics. It was an engaging subject that facilitated effective literature search for specific projects.

   Completing this assignment highlighted the need for a clearer timeline in my final year dissertation as I initially progressed ahead of schedule but fell slightly behind during the final stages.

Collaborating with a peer strengthened my grasp of SPSS, data interpretation, dividing participants into groups, which boosted my confidence in writing up results and discussion. Initially, formulating the research question was challenging due to numerous ideas about what to investigate. However, I am satisfied with our final topic as it was relevant to our interests. Our findings were intriguing; all results were non-significant, suggesting limitations in past studies reporting significant results or potential flaws in our own research design. This experience broadened my understanding of neuroticism, love languages, and relationship satisfaction, enriching knowledge about social psychology, personality, and romantic relationships. In retrospect, I could have deepened my learning by engaging with more literature prior to the study and systematically addressing questions that arose. The process reinforced the importance of precise data collection in strengthening critical thinking skills and statistical knowledge, particularly regarding methodological flaws impacting study outcomes.

"Initially, I was nervous about this research assignment because creating and carrying out an experiment seemed intimidating. However, as the project developed, I became more involved with the process. One of the most enjoyable components was designing the experimental program; despite having no prior coding knowledge, my partner and I were able to create the WCST task through independent study with online resources. This unexpected accomplishment has given me faith in my capacity to learn new technical abilities when necessary. The group dynamics posed substantial obstacles. With only two of us actively participating after other members disengaged, the workload was substantial. While managing all areas of the project with two individuals required careful coordination, we were able to establish a productive working cadence. This experience demonstrated both the challenges of collaborative work when participation is uneven and the unexpected efficiency that might arise in a smaller, more devoted team. In retrospect, I realize that my lack of straightforward communication about these difficulties. Rather than addressing the unequal involvement, I withdrew from group contacts, which I now realize was unproductive. This has taught me valuable lessons about professional accountability and conflict resolution, which I will employ in future joint projects. The project's challenges were eventually outweighed by its rewards. Problem-solving through technical obstacles and seeing our technique implemented offered true gratification. I've learnt not only certain research skills, but also increased confidence in my ability to conquer challenges. This encounter transformed my perception of academic work as both rigorous and creatively fascinating.","Initially I was nervous about this research assignment because creating and carrying out an experiment seemed intimidating.

"The idea of a mini dissertation seemed challenging initially, but it soon became one of my favorite modules. Working in a group did have disadvantages; for instance, several members of my group had personal obligations preventing them from attending lab sessions. However, we all communicated effectively, allowing us to stay on track and meet deadlines early. This experience taught me not just the challenges of group work but also the benefits of teamwork and developing strong communication skills. I initially lacked confidence in data analysis; using SPSS and acquiring data could be intimidating. Despite the difficulty, I followed step-by-step instructions using ANOVA worksheets and was quite satisfied with the results when I collected data via graphs and SPSS outputs. Data collection was one of my concerns, yet our group managed to recruit numerous participants in a short time frame. Both parts of this module boosted my confidence in conducting future research. Performing my own research has made me aware of how easy it is for research to have limitations, such as participant biases and cultural differences. I understand that critically evaluating conducted research and pointing out any drawbacks is crucial. This mini dissertation has given me more trust for my final-year project; although I will need to complete this independently, the learning experience has taught me how to analyze large amounts of data and identify various measurements.","The idea of a mini dissertation appeared initially challenging, but it soon became one of my favorites.

"Reflecting on the decision-making process of the research project, our group started with numerous ideas for various topics and eventually confirmed the topic in question. I have learned a great deal about the complexity of studying the impact of media on public perception. One of the initial challenges we faced was narrowing down the topic. Initially, we wanted to do something related to criminal psychology, but this was too broad for us to finalize a suitable and appropriate topic. In the end, we focused on something we encounter frequently in real life and implemented it. Throughout the project, I had difficulties with data collection, particularly recruiting a diverse enough group of participants. The majority of respondents were college students, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, because of our low impact, we often struggled with anxiety during the survey process as to whether or not we would get enough responses to the questionnaire. In submitting my thesis, I felt both a sense of accomplishment and relief. I was satisfied with the results of the research and the insights it provided into the role of media in shaping public fear. As I look forward to next year, I am more confident in my research abilities, but I also recognize that there is still much to learn about methodology and academic writing. This project has been a valuable learning experience, and I look forward to further improving my abilities in future research so that I can use my expertise to study criminal psychology topics next year.","Reflecting on the decision-making process of the research project, our group started with numerous ideas for various topics and eventually confirmed the topic in question.

"Overall, the Mini-Dissertation experience was a rollercoaster; it was enjoyable but also stressful. Confidence grew significantly throughout. Working with a group was fun, fostering teamwork and communication skills, although it did not fully alleviate confusion experienced. The process was unique to each individual, and fast-paced, making one feel behind at times. However, valuable lessons were learned for next year. Initial encounter with exported data on Excel was overwhelming, but upon understanding, realized its simplicity. Running and interpreting the data was difficult due to extended time since writing a lab report. Nonetheless, managed to complete in the end. In conclusion, this process initiated thoughts about potential 3rd-year research topics and provided a rough idea of the process. Skills such as critical thinking, exporting data, interpreting and cleaning data, and refreshing SPSS skills (creating graphs and reading descriptive statistics) were acquired. Overall, the experience was incredibly beneficial, despite being stressful and confusing at times.","Overall, the Mini-Dissertation experience was a rollercoaster; it was enjoyable but also stressful.

"What a task; the mini dissertation was not easy. This was the most stressful piece of work given. The decision-making process was done with me and two coworkers. Challenges were faced during the write-up for this piece of work. I have had many things going on related to family and personal struggles that have made it difficult to do this piece of work. I deeply regret and am saddened by the piece of work created, although I am a bit happy I made this mini dissertation on my own. I should have asked for help earlier. Despite everything going on within my life, I struggled with the stats part, especially the SPSS part. I know I've done it wrong, but there is nothing I can do now. This has given me an insight into the actual one in third year, for which I need to take all lessons and shortcomings to do better. I hope I pass this. For the third year, I need to work on not letting life get in the way, take it step by step, and avoid accumulating tasks. I also need to work on my SPSS stats to reduce stress. Finally, I just need to be more aware and work accordingly. When I look back at this piece of work in third year, I hope and will ensure that I show myself with not just a pass but high-grading outstanding work.

"Through completing this mini-dissertation project, I have learned and revisited a variety of different skills and research techniques necessary to complete the task, making the experience surprisingly enjoyable and not as overwhelming as initially thought. Working with a group helped me overcome initial fears regarding this assignment, such as workload, but collaborating and discussing with peers boosted my confidence and morale. The use of software such as SPSS and Qualtrics allowed me to develop analysis skills and further understand data interpretation, as I experienced it first-hand with personally collected data, making it easier to comprehend. When analyzing my data, I learned how crucial it is to be thorough with data collection, as well as developing a study with a sample that is more feasible or easily sought after, which was an issue I encountered. This experience increased my confidence in areas where I felt the most weak and my confidence in dissertation-style writing as a whole, which I will carry with me when writing my final dissertation in my final year.","Through completing this mini-dissertation project, I have learned and revisited various skills and research techniques necessary for the task, making the experience surprisingly enjoyable and not as overwhelming as initially thought.

"I was always aware since year 1 that it was necessary for all students to complete a dissertation by the end of year 3, however this thought had been rather scary until now. This mini-dissertation provided an opportunity to practice the skills required to perform well in my dissertation next year. It was far from easy or perfect, but I learned immensely during the low moments when I felt lost in what I was doing, and from any mistakes made along the way. This experience now leaves me feeling prepared and much more at ease for the academic year ahead. To elaborate, analyzing the data collected from my research proved challenging and overwhelming at times. However, the more time I spent with SPSS, I was able to reach correct conclusions. For me, the excitement I have derived from figuring out how to navigate data analysis has made it the best part of this project for me. It provided a great sense of achievement knowing that I overcame any doubts or confusion in my mind. Another highlight of this project was receiving responses from our study. My team and I were pleasantly surprised by the number of participants we got so quickly, making the data collection process smooth sailing. Working as a group has been one of the main reasons I felt more comfortable starting this project. At first, I was worried about working with others due to concerns over conflicting ideas, however this was not the case. My team and I had similar interests going into this, and each member brought different ideas and solutions to issues. Communication has been good, despite not everyone being in the labs at the same times. In particular, I took some time off for an unexpected Pro-Social Behaviour 15 last-minute surgery. I ensured to keep in touch with my team while recovering, asking what I could do from home. My team was extremely thoughtful and helpful during this time. Designing my own research, analyzing and reporting it has given me a great insight into what being a psychologist is. Our essays mean we must examine many reports and studies, and it has been enlightening to experience the process of these studies from start to finish.","I was always aware since year 1 that it was necessary for all students to complete a dissertation by the end of year 3; however, this thought had been rather scary until now.

"Completing this Mini-Dissertation has been a rewarding and challenging experience. The process of conducting this study has deepened my understanding of how to approach psychological study from developing research questions and analyzing the results. I found the topic quite challenging and interesting. There were several challenges along the way, such as ensuring our IV and DV were operationalized. Relying on self-reported menstrual cycle data introduced uncertainties. One of the key difficulties I encountered was using SPSS and analyzing the data, ensuring it was in the right format. I had lots of help from my peers, and I'm glad we were in a group together as it made it much more fun. Through this study, I have learned the importance of having clear operationalized variables, working in a group setting, and managing my studies effectively.","Completing this Mini-Dissertation has been a rewarding and challenging experience.
