"Teamwork, Personal Growth, Technical Skills",Resilient,0.9821,"This mini-dissertation project was both rewarding and challenging, offering valuable insights into the research process and personal growth. Initially, the prospect of conducting an experiment with friends was exhilarating. The opportunity to independently investigate a topic made me feel like a PhD student embarking on an exciting academic journey. However, I quickly realized that effective teamwork requires more than simply dividing roles within a group. Successful collaboration involves understanding the unique working styles, communication preferences, and pacing of team members. While adapting to these differences proved challenging at times, the shared stress of the project ultimately brought us closer together. It revealed the true personalities of my teammates - who are also my friends - and highlighted their helpfulness and consideration during moments when I faced personal challenges. This project significantly enhanced my technical skills, particularly in using SPSS and conducting ANOVA analyses. Although I encountered setbacks, including having to redo the entire project to ensure variable differentiation within the team, these obstacles strengthened my resilience and problem-solving abilities. Balancing academic pressures alongside part-time work, family responsibilities, and Ramadan was overwhelming at times, but the support and guidance from my team members helped me persevere. Ultimately, this experience has been instrumental in shaping me as a future researcher. It has taught me to critically evaluate my own work and approach research papers with a more analytical perspective. The skills I have developed throughout this project will undoubtedly prove invaluable as I progress into my third year and undertake my dissertation.","Here are some advice, recommendations, or tips the student gives to future students or themselves:

"Teamwork, Research Methods, Personal Growth",Resilient,0.9614,"Initially, I believed that working in a group who did not know me at all would be incredibly daunting and overwhelming. However, after the first week, I felt much more comfortable working as a group as they were forgiving and patient with me submitting ideas and potential solutions to issues and roadblocks. However, that is not to say it was flawless as a lot of jargon and technical info such as data analysis went over all our heads, and we had no idea collectively how to approach these issues. At first, data analysis was overbearing with it always being in the back of my mind with no conceivable way on how to approach it or conduct it and I pushed it back throughout the entire dissertation process, ignoring it until last minute which really halted progress and forced me to learn how to conduct it in SPSS. Even throughout the analysis, I was holding onto the chance the analysis was wrong, and I did everything I could to make sure it was not, so I made too many stats in the end which were not added to the dissertation or open materials. Finally, designing and running the group Qualtrics survey and figuring out how to port it to excel and edit all the unimportant data really taught me a valuable lesson that psychological research is not instant or simple. Even coming out of it, the tasks are still daunting and soul-crushing looking back on it but now I can say I achieved what I set out to do with my group and we all performed as well as we could have done together. Not only has this survey taught me about the hardships of running a study but also how inconsistent the collection is as everyone will have different answers, some will answer the question wrong or misinterpret what the question says, giving vague answers or only answering with 'not sure/prefer not to say' for most questions. This ultimately made me feel more at ease when I participate in surveys because I know I'm not going to answer correctly but I now have the knowledge the researcher just wants the data. Overall, the mini-dissertation has made me a lot more confident in approaching the third-year dissertation by being more outgoing with my design and potentially working with multiple collaborators for advice and assistance as well as going more in depth on a topic than initially intended.","The student recommends future students to be open and patient when working in a group they are not familiar with, and emphasizes the importance of asking questions or seeking help when encountering technical issues such as data analysis. Additionally, they advise against procrastination, especially when it comes to challenging tasks like data analysis, suggesting that it can hinder progress and cause unnecessary stress. Lastly, they suggest gaining confidence by being more outgoing with design and potentially collaborating with multiple people for advice and assistance, as well as going in-depth on a topic than initially intended."
"Teamwork, Communication, Research Process",Frustrated,0.9898,"Overall, my experience with this dissertation was quite challenging and at times frustrating. While it was nice to work as a team for a change and share ideas regarding the research and study setup, the process was often hindered by one group member's frequent absence. This made the dissertation feel more like a two-person project, and having an extra, more engaged member might have made the experience run much more smoothly. A major issue throughout was the lack of communication outside of our lab sessions, which is something we all could have improved upon. Since we rarely interacted beyond those two hours, it was often difficult to stay on the same page.

   A good example of this miscommunication occurred over the Christmas break when we had planned to help each other with the Ethics Submission documents. However, when it came to the information sheet, we were left in the dark and had to create one ourselves, only to later discover that the absent group member had made their own version without informing us. Additionally, there were times when I asked questions and received no response from my fellow researchers, which made aspects of the project even more difficult.

   Another significant challenge was my experience with SPSS. For most of the year, I was unable to access the software, and even when I resolved the issue, there were instances where SPSS would not seem to generate data. This was incredibly frustrating, but in the end, it was a huge relief when everything finally worked as expected.

   Despite these challenges, I found our lab teacher to be incredibly helpful throughout the process as they supported our ideas, encouraged us, and told us what needed to be done to overcome any problems we may face. Their guidance made a significant difference, especially with regards to the Impact of Nicotine Withdrawal and Anhedonia when we struggled to understand certain aspects of the study or needed clarification on our methodology.

   Their support helped bridge some of the gaps caused by the lack of team communication, and I really appreciated their patience and expertise. While this experience had its difficulties, it has given me a clearer understanding of the research process and the importance of effective teamwork. Despite the frustrations faced from this mini dissertation, I am still looking forward to investigating my third-year dissertation independently, where I can take full control of my research and be better organized when it comes to setting up my research.","Tips for future students:

1. Strive for effective team communication: Regularly communicate with your group members outside scheduled lab sessions to ensure everyone is on the same page and aware of each other's progress. This can help prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications that might hinder the project.

2. Have a backup plan for crucial tasks or deadlines: In case one group member is frequently absent, have an alternative approach or schedule to ensure the work continues smoothly without delaying the progress of the project.

3. Be patient with learning new software or tools: If you encounter challenges with unfamiliar programs like SPSS, don't lose hope, and keep trying to resolve issues. Persistence will eventually lead to mastery and a more enjoyable research experience.

4. Leverage guidance from instructors and mentors: When facing difficulties in your research, seek help and guidance from teachers or mentors who are experienced in the field. Their support can bridge gaps caused by miscommunication within the team and offer valuable insights that improve the quality of your work.

5. Develop organization skills: Working on a group project can be chaotic, so improving organizational skills will make it easier to manage tasks, keep track of deadlines, and maintain a clear understanding of the research process. This will help you in your third-year dissertation when working independently."

I wanted to showcase my project management skills, generate and share ideas diplomatically, and work well with others. As the project progressed, I felt confused about the delivery side. Balancing communication, mental health, physical health, and time management was tough. Learning how to handle data technically felt overwhelming, especially as I didn't even know how to extend a column in Excel at the beginning. This made working with the messy dataset even more stressful. Although lab sessions provided clear guidance on running and formatting analyses, applying those instructions independently was harder than expected. With poor computer literacy, learning technical skills without direct support was a challenge throughout the project. Despite all that, I am genuinely proud of pulling this report together - especially learning how to export, clean, and manage data properly, which seemed beyond me at the start. I improved my practical research skills in unexpected ways. If I could change anything, it would be designing a study that made more sense for analysis, instead of choosing something quick and easy to get responses for. I would also advise myself to plan difficult steps carefully, seek clarification earlier, and not guess what was involved in working with data vaguely. This project challenged me more than anticipated, but it made me stronger and more confident for future research projects like my dissertation; because even though it takes me a little (a lot) longer to do data analysis, I can actually do it!","The student offers several pieces of advice:

1. Plan difficult steps carefully: The student advises taking time to plan out complicated tasks in advance and not rushing into them without proper preparation.
2. Seek clarification earlier: Instead of guessing what's involved in working with data, the student suggests asking for clarification as early as possible.

"Complexity of Academic Research, Data Analysis, Planning, Flexibility, Adaptability",Resilient,0.981,"This project's decision-making demonstrated the impact of planning and flexibility on outcomes. Goals were established for sociability, academic performance, and belonging. My hypothesis suggested that sociability would influence belongingness more than academic success. The project encountered challenges, primarily in the literature review stage. Prior studies had linked sociability and belonging. A broader research focus was necessary. After reviewing literature and findings, it became clear that numerous social, environmental, and individual factors might impact belongingness, which the research design could not fully account for. Instead, sociability and academic success predicted belongingness. Consequently, I altered my study topic to better analyze the data. Data analysis proved challenging. Interpreting 2x2 ANOVA results without significant effects was difficult. I attempted to reconcile the lack of relevance with evidence supporting the importance of sociability. After further contemplation, I recognized these findings might necessitate a deeper understanding of belongingness and personal and institutional issues. At one point, I considered giving up. However, study technique, data processing, and adaptability helped me navigate unexpected results. Next year, I am more confident in my hypotheses, critical research skills, and adaptability. This experience underscored the complexity of academic research.","The student's advice to future students or themselves is:
    - Embrace planning and flexibility in your projects as they significantly impact outcomes.
    - Be prepared for challenges, especially during the literature review stage, and be open to broadening your research focus if necessary.

Data Analysis & Research Methods,Relieved,-0.6858,"At the beginning, things went smoothly as we decided on a relationship-related research focusing on neuroticism with love languages as an additional factor. Piecing together the study using validated questionnaires was straightforward. However, data analysis proved challenging. We excluded multiple participants and found an outlier during analysis, leading to conflicts about removing them. Eventually, they were removed, but working with SPSS remained difficult. Initially, we performed the incorrect ANOVA, but rectifying it made subsequent steps easier. Overall, this experience was insightful and reduced the dread of working on a research project alone next year.","The student recommends being prepared for potential challenges during data analysis when working with statistical software like SPSS. They also suggest carefully considering and resolving any conflicts that may arise during the process, such as deciding whether to exclude participants based on outliers or other factors. Lastly, they emphasize the importance of understanding and correctly applying statistical methods, such as ANOVA, to ensure subsequent steps are easier to navigate."
"Research Design, Collaboration, Time Management, Personal Growth",Frustrated,0.7339,"I found conducting this research challenging as I had anticipated struggling less due to previous lab-report analysis experience. Designing and conducting a study, particularly using Qualtrics and obtaining participants, proved more difficult than expected. In retrospect, I should have familiarized myself with Qualtrics earlier and ensured an even distribution of participants between conditions. Working with only one other person instead of three increased the workload, necessitating assistance in areas such as SPSS. For future collaborations, I will strive for evenly distributed workload and clearer communication. This would have allowed for improved study design, a larger sample size, and enhanced materials via video recording instead of using a written vignette. Additionally, narrowing the scope of my research was challenging due to my interest in ASD. This led to covering multiple areas within my lab report, such as the double empathy problem, misdiagnosis in women, and issues with previous research, resulting in exceeding the word count by double. For future projects, I will plan ahead and approximate word counts for each section. Despite these challenges, I enjoyed this project due to its relevance to my interests. Designing my study provided insight into the process of being a researcher.","Advice:

* Familiarize yourself with Qualtrics earlier when designing and conducting a study.
* Ensure an even distribution of participants between conditions for better study design.
* For future collaborations, strive for an evenly distributed workload and clearer communication to improve the project's outcome.
* Narrow the scope of research to avoid exceeding word count limits in future projects.
* Plan ahead and approximate word counts for each section to stay within the assigned limit.
* Working on a narrower topic will allow for a more focused and concise lab report."
Research Process and Psychological Study Design,Relieved,0.9729,"Conducting this experiment was a challenging yet rewarding experience that taught me a lot about the research process. One of the most important lessons I learned was the importance of choosing the right measures. In hindsight, I should have used a mood survey that assessed general mood, not mood in the moment. As the survey only captured how participants were feeling at that exact time, it likely missed patterns in their usual emotional state, which may have affected the results. Recruiting participants went better than expected, and I was pleased to meet the sample size needed for analysis. Collecting and managing data provided practical experience with tools like Qualtrics and SPSS and helped me understand how to apply ethical guidelines in real-world research. Interpreting the results was both exciting and thought-provoking. It was encouraging to see a clear link between social media use and body dissatisfaction, but I was surprised that mood didn't play a bigger role. This reflection led me to consider the strengths and limitations of my design and measures. Overall, this project boosted my confidence and gave me a much deeper understanding of what's involved in running a psychological study from start to finish.","The advice or tip given by the student is about choosing appropriate measures in research. They suggest that instead of using a mood survey that assesses mood in the moment, it might be more beneficial to use one that evaluates general mood. This could help capture patterns in participants' usual emotional state, potentially providing more accurate and insightful results."
"Research Design, Data Analysis, Personal Growth",Reflective,0.9853,"Working as a group has always been a mixed experience for me, involving highly engaged members and those who contribute less. At the start of our project, the group dynamic lacked cohesion, with few actively participating while others either worked independently without communicating or remained largely disengaged. This lack of coordination left some unaware of the project's progress, making collaboration difficult. As the project developed, collaboration improved and became more effective. Despite initial difficulties, I found the experience enjoyable because we had autonomy over a topic that interested us all. One key difficulty was our complex research design; enthusiasm led to including multiple variables, complicating the study. This confusion affected data analysis. Reflecting, I acknowledge the importance of clear, focused research questions and manageable designs for future projects. Data analysis proved challenging, as interpreting Qualtrics data and navigating SPSS initially felt overwhelming. Despite guidance, I struggled with certain concepts, but this struggle refined my research skills. Moving forward, I will dedicate time to improving proficiency in SPSS and statistical analysis for the final-year dissertation. Challenges included a small sample size limiting reliability, difficulty recruiting participants, participant fatigue causing missing data, and designing an engaging yet concise study. These issues taught me about common research problems such as poor measure selection, small sample sizes, and participant dropout, and their impact on findings interpretation. I now understand that psychological research is uncertain, relying on statistical inference rather than definitive conclusions. Completing this mini-dissertation boosted my confidence in pursuing the final-year dissertation, equipping me to develop clear research questions, choose appropriate measures, and analyze data using SPSS. More importantly, I gained confidence to conduct research on a topic I am passionate about, ensuring that my dissertation will be meaningful and well-structured.","1. For future projects, focus on clear, focused research questions and manageable designs to avoid complications during data analysis.

2. Improve proficiency in SPSS and statistical analysis for better handling of data in future projects, especially for the final-year dissertation.

"Psychology Research Methods, Independence, Perseverance",Resilient,0.9757,"Completing this mini-dissertation was both a challenging and rewarding experience. At the outset, I was intrigued by the idea that subtle communication cues - such as a speaker's title or use of medical jargon - could influence how individuals perceive their own health. Designing a 2x2 factorial experiment allowed me to explore this in a structured, empirical way. However, transforming an abstract idea into a fully realized study required constant critical thinking, organization, and attention to detail. One of the most valuable aspects of this project was learning how to operationalize variables, particularly self-rated health (SRH). Adapting items from the SF-36 survey and reverse coding them taught me about the importance of handling measurement tools carefully to ensure validity. Writing the Methods and Results sections helped solidify my understanding of statistical testing, especially two-way ANOVA, and the importance of power analysis. I also gained experience navigating Qualtrics for randomisation and survey design. Perhaps the most significant growth came during the Discussion section, where I had to critically evaluate my findings, acknowledge limitations, and consider future directions. While my hypotheses were only partially supported, this taught me that null or unexpected results are still meaningful and can inform theory and practice. Overall, this project deepened my understanding of how psychology research is conducted and the importance of methodological transparency. It also reinforced my ability to manage anxiety under pressure, work independently, and persevere through complex tasks - skills I will carry forward in my academic and professional journey.","The student's advice for future students or themselves includes:

1. Embrace the challenge: Be prepared for a challenging but rewarding experience when conducting research.

2. Critical thinking, organization, and attention to detail are crucial: These skills are essential in transforming an abstract idea into a fully realized study.

"Research Design, Time Management, Critical Thinking",Determined,0.9066,"As I near the end of this module and project, I feel a mix of satisfaction and the weight of a considerable workload. Choosing our topic was particularly difficult as we aimed to focus it on a specific niche that appealed to all team members. Forensic psychology stood out as an area of deep interest, especially in critiquing current investigative methods. Through an extensive literature review, we found that criminal profiling is often viewed as an outdated or abandoned technique. This discovery sparked our curiosity about the cognitive mechanisms involved in suspect identification – specifically, how individuals rely on superficial cues, contextual information, and whether implicit biases distort judgment due to profiling's reliance on subjective interpretation rather than objective, empirical evidence. One of the most challenging aspects of this project was the word limit, which often felt constricting. I grappled with finding a balance between depth and breadth, as certain areas required more exploration to build a more comprehensive and nuanced argument. This challenge necessitated careful refinement to ensure clarity and coherence without sacrificing critical insights. Throughout the process, I frequently adjusted my approach based on feedback and self-reflection. Initially, my methodology was too broad, so I narrowed it for a more precise and targeted analysis. Furthermore, when some sources did not align with my expectations, I had to reassess my interpretations to maintain analytical consistency. Moving forward, I feel both excited and determined. This project has taught me valuable time management skills and how to think critically about my research approach. I look forward to applying these skills to future assignments and continuing to refine my academic work.","The student provides several recommendations for future students or themselves:

1. When choosing a topic, aim for one that appeals to all team members and has a specific niche focus.

2. Be open to exploring less conventional areas of interest, such as critiquing outdated or controversial techniques, which can spark curiosity about underlying cognitive mechanisms.

3. Learn how to balance depth and breadth within the given word limit, ensuring clarity, coherence, and critical insights without sacrificing essential information.

Research Methods & Collaboration,Anxious,0.8519,"My research focused on the relationship between gender and personality's influence on conformity among individuals. Peer influence on group conformity was of particular interest. Based on prior research, I anticipated finding that more conscientious individuals, especially females, would exhibit higher levels of conformity compared to their less conscientious counterparts and males. During this project, the SPSS analysis presented a challenge due to unexpectedly prolonged time requirements for result gathering. This left me with reduced time for analysis, leading to feelings of anxiety primarily stemming from my unfamiliarity with SPSS. To overcome these challenges, I broke the process down into smaller sections and took the necessary time to better comprehend it. This assignment proved difficult due to collaborative group work, as trusting peers to complete assigned tasks was challenging for me. However, this experience helped me grow as a student by fostering my skills in research-based projects that will be beneficial for my dissertation next year.","The student provides several pieces of advice and tips:

Research Conduct & Learning,Resilient,0.9802,"Through this project, I have learned much about research conduct. Initially, I was overwhelmed by choice but talking with others helped me narrow selections. Struggling with search skills and terms led to improved search proficiency (e.g., using 'personality' instead of 'neuroticism'). While creating the study, compromise on measurement and participant engagement was a challenge. Organizational skills had to be improved for others' accommodation. Decision-making abilities were enhanced by considering all factors. The sample was small and unrepresentative due to lack of knowledge in gathering participants and maintaining interest. Next time, I will take an active role in participant acquisition as I did not try enough. Data analysis was difficult and required multiple revisions, but completion boosted my confidence in data understanding, analysis, and conclusion-drawing from statistics. If asked again, I would be prepared to complete well.","The student provides several tips for future students or themselves:

1. Discuss with others to narrow selections when overwhelmed by choice.
2. Improve search skills and terms, such as using 'personality' instead of 'neuroticism'.
3. Work on organizational skills for others' accommodation during the project.

5. Take an active role in participant acquisition when gathering data for a study.
6. Be prepared for data analysis, as it may require multiple revisions but will boost confidence in understanding and analyzing data, as well as drawing conclusions from statistics."
"Collaboration, Leadership, Overcoming Challenges, Navigating University System, Independence, Future Preparations",Resilient,0.9424,"Throughout the decision-making process, I learned the value of compromise and collaboration. There were times when I had to make sacrifices for group cohesion, and this taught me a valuable lesson: never to overvalue my own perspective above others. Everyone brings their own passion and reasoning to the table, and I've learned to give others' ideas the same energy and consideration I give my own. One of the main challenges we faced as a group was the difference in priorities, motivation, and discipline when it came to data collection and completing the project. Realistically, only two of us fully contributed, which made the workload unfairly distributed. This was frustrating at times, but it taught me a lot about leadership, patience, and accountability. Another significant challenge was the lack of a reliable structure within the university. The system often felt inconsistent and unclear, with different tutors and lecturers offering conflicting information. It was difficult to feel confident in the direction we were taking, especially when guidance varied so widely. Additionally, there seemed to be an imbalance in support - some students had access to module leaders, while others were assigned to fellows who couldn't provide definitive answers. This created an uneven playing field and made it harder to feel confident in our work. We had to make several adjustments during the project, such as introducing a control variable and increasing the number of scenarios, which required flexibility and extra time that wasn't always easy to find under these conditions. At the point of submission, I feel uneasy. There are still aspects of the project that remain unclear, and I worry that by the time proper help arrives, it'll be too late. Looking ahead to next year, I feel nervous. Working closely with a professor is something I'm expected to do, but based on my experience so far, I worry that I'll encounter the same lack of structure and support. In all honesty, I would prefer to work independently - at least that way, the outcome is fully in my hands, and I'm not left waiting on a system or individuals that aren't consistent. Still, I'm hopeful that with the lessons I've learned this year, I'll be able to navigate future challenges with more resilience and clarity.","Advice:

1. Learn the value of compromise and collaboration. Give others' ideas the same energy and consideration as your own.
2. In group work, understand that everyone may not contribute equally, which can lead to an unfair workload distribution. Practice patience and accountability in such situations.

"Research Design, Data Analysis, Learning, Future Plans",Relieved,0.9896,"During this time, I designed, composed, and completed my experiment and mini-dissertation. Many decisions needed to be made such as choosing IV (Independent Variable) and DV (Dependent Variable), which was difficult due to differing opinions. We eventually chose one idea each that fit into similar categories. My choice was attachment style, intriguing and suitable for studying alongside relationship satisfaction and impulsivity. We chose a questionnaire because it was straightforward and easy for analysis but preprocessing the data proved complex with vast amounts requiring coding and conversion into meaningful data plots. Deciding what to include and exclude presented challenges. The ethical approval process posed difficulties, with many sends back and rejects before approval. We had to keep making small changes to the design and variables to gain approval. Errors in the questionnaire design after publishing caused processing and translating issues, leading to adjustments within data analysis like reverse coding the data, adding different representatives, using means, and discluding certain data that would have hindered processing and study results. If I were to repeat this study, I might use a different basis of measurement and questionnaires. I'd carefully compose the questionnaire with this in mind. I feel relieved at submission, as it was stressful, but excited for next year and my main dissertation. I learned much from this experience and enjoyed most of the challenges along the way. I am eager to explore new topics and construct something based on my interests and future career in psychology.","If I were to advise a future student embarking on a similar project, here's what I would suggest:

1. Be prepared for numerous decisions that need to be made during the research process, especially when it comes to selecting IV and DV. It's essential to choose variables that fit into similar categories and are suitable for your study.

2. Opt for a straightforward method of data collection such as a questionnaire, but keep in mind that preprocessing the data might be complex and require significant coding and conversion efforts.

3. Carefully consider what data to include and exclude during the analysis phase. This decision can greatly impact the results of your study.

4. Anticipate hurdles in the ethical approval process, as it may involve many revisions to your design and variables before approval is granted.

Research Skills & Confidence,Resilient,0.9845,"Throughout this project, I have gained a significantly deeper understanding of psychological research. Readings and studies assigned throughout the academic year provided me with a solid foundation in psychology; however, hands-on experience of conducting research has truly enhanced my knowledge - a key reason for choosing this university. The journey of completing this mini-dissertation was not without challenges; setup issues with SPSS data caused significant problems during ANOVA and descriptive statistics analysis. Multiple lecturers' guidance proved incredibly helpful, both in troubleshooting technical issues and strengthening my understanding of the software, boosting confidence in data analysis. The writing process presented its own set of challenges - repetition of key points across different sections of the dissertation led me to reflect on creating a coherent and concise flow in future assignments. Although this project has been difficult at times, it has provided valuable learning experiences. Though my submission is not what I ideally would have it look like, I am proud of the progress I have made. I eagerly anticipate receiving feedback, as I believe it will be beneficial for further refining research skills and advancing my academic journey for the next year.","The student recommends the following:

"Independent Research, Teamwork, Time Management, Data Analysis, Personal Growth",Relieved,0.9839,"Initially, the concept of producing my own research seemed incredibly daunting and unachievable. Confusing and intense work to complete individually, starting a group project and writing the lab report independently. However, members did not attend a large percentage of lab sessions and did not contribute equally when designing the study and making resources. This experience taught the importance of reliable teammates and active communication between group members to minimize conflict and ensure an even distribution of work. Despite this, the other group members worked effectively together to meet deadlines. Although it was a significant workload, lab times and internal deadlines recommended by lab tutors helped turn the work into manageable pieces. Data analysis was intimidating at first; however, we surpassed our expected number of participants and had a larger sample size. This created an obstacle: an Excel spreadsheet over 100 rows long. It took trial and error, but with help from our lab tutor and YouTube videos, we processed our data to the stage where we could run an ANOVA. This experience highlighted that making mistakes initially is okay and can often be reversed or remedied. It also showed how much just trying can teach you. Although it took a few attempts, eventually, variables were transformed. This feeling of self-achievement was shortly replaced with disappointment as my results were not significant. After discussing with my lab tutor, I realized that non-significant results are still important. I feel this is an incredibly important realization for an aspiring psychologist. My research found a contradiction to previous research, although the analysis may have been non-significant; the contradiction is a significant contribution to the field. It is important to learn not to be disappointed by this. Ultimately, I now feel more confident with the idea of completing my own completely independent dissertation next year. I feel more comfortable with data analysis and have a good idea of which aspects are the most time-consuming or require the most attention. It has also given me valuable experience in organizing my time to make a very large and daunting project more approachable by setting internal deadlines and holding myself accountable. I have really enjoyed this topic and look forward to my dissertation next year.","1. Choose reliable teammates for group projects, and ensure clear communication among all members.
2. Break down large workloads into manageable pieces by setting internal deadlines.
3. Don't be discouraged by initial mistakes or non-significant results; they can often lead to valuable contributions in the field.
4. Gaining experience with data analysis will make future independent research more comfortable, and organizing your time effectively is crucial for managing large projects."
"Time Management, Research Design, Personal Growth",Motivated,0.9777,"It was honestly reassuring to be in a group with others who, like me, had a lot going on outside of university. We understood each other's time pressures and this helped keep us motivated, even if it also meant a fair bit of last-minute scrambling. That said, I learned a lot from that. I went in with some quite narrow ideas about how to measure things, and it wasn't until I was deep in the process that I realized I needed to shift gears, and kind of make the most of what I had. So while the final version came together (somewhat) in the end, it definitely felt like I was piecing things together in real time, rather than having a clear vision from the beginning. Next year, I'm actually looking forward to approaching my dissertation with a clearer vision and structure right from the start. I've now got a much better sense of what works, what doesn't, and how much planning really helps. Also, no longer being intimidated by SPSS or Excel helps a lot.","1. Work well in groups with others who have similar time pressures as you can help keep each other motivated, even if it means last-minute scrambling.
2. Be flexible and open to shifting gears when necessary. Don't stick too closely to initial ideas or plans, especially when they prove not to be effective.

Teamwork & Collaboration,Relieved,0.9643,"At the start of the year, even thinking about a mini dissertation was daunting. I felt unprepared. As we formed groups and brainstormed ideas, I originally felt worried that as a group, we wouldn't be able to come together and produce a piece of work that we were all proud of. However, the difficulty of this project brought our small group together, and we supported each other throughout the process. Throughout the process of picking a topic, allocating variables and interactions for us all to choose, and then getting started with the study formation, we began to work together much more seamlessly than when we started. Working in a group has taught me how to rely on others for parts I feel less confident in. I also learned to lend a helping hand to my colleagues when they were feeling less confident in an area that I was confident in. This experience has helped a lot with the feeling of impending doom when thinking about my dissertation next year as I already know what I need to do to get started and what to focus on. I feel much more confident about going into year 3, knowing how to produce a piece of work that I can be proud of.","The student shares the following advice for future students:

1. Don't be daunted by challenging projects at the beginning – it's normal to feel unprepared.
2. Working in a group can bring people together and help produce better work.
3. Rely on others for areas you feel less confident in, and offer help where you excel.
4. Starting early and focusing on what needs to be done can help alleviate feelings of impending doom when facing similar tasks in the future.
5. Reflecting on past experiences can help build confidence for future challenges."
,,0.9934,"At the beginning of this project, I was excited to explore gender differences in perception, particularly how gendered language shapes attitudes towards job roles. Initially, I had to adapt my original idea due to other team members focusing on similar areas. Despite being initially disappointed, I remained open-minded and embraced the opportunity to work in a team. I enjoyed working with my partner overall, but collaboration came with difficulties. One challenge was our disagreement over using visual stimuli; I wanted to present job ads within stereotypically masculine and feminine office spaces, but we couldn't agree on their appearance, resulting in a change of direction that delayed progress. A significant challenge for me was SPSS; I initially felt overwhelmed by it but grew more confident as time passed. Unfortunately, technical issues led to the loss of data outputs, preventing me from recreating graphs shown to Caroline. Although I'm proud of the work submitted, it's not as comprehensive as it could have been. Moving forward, I understand the importance of completing tasks ahead of deadlines and seeking help when things go wrong. The project has highlighted the significance of visual and language-based framing in gendered communication, especially within marketing. In future projects, especially my final-year dissertation, I'd like to explore topics that integrate academic interests with professional fields, focusing on the power of gendered words and improving my ability to create engaging experimental materials reflective of real-world applications. Although this project may not be the piece I'm most proud of, it served as a turning point in my perception of myself as a researcher, providing clarity on values, voice, and future explorations. At submission, I feel a mix of pride, frustration, and relief but primarily motivated for what comes next.","The student provides the following advice or tips:

1. Stay open-minded when working in a team, as it may lead to opportunities that you hadn't initially considered.

"Research, Teamwork, Perseverance",Relieved,0.9859,"I was extremely excited to complete a mini-dissertation, however, I was skeptical about doing it as a group. Past experiences working in groups didn't give me much confidence; however, as the weeks went by, I realized I could rely on them. There were some weeks where motivation to come into labs decreased and most of us, including myself, didn't attend. If I was to do another group project again, I would take more advantage of the resources and support from the labs because towards the end, I found myself getting confused on analyzing data using SPSS. However, even though obtaining the statistical data seemed impossible towards the end, I managed to push through. With trial and error, it took me a full day to figure it out, but nonetheless, I'm proud that I persevered. Now, I can use SPSS with more confidence than before, and it doesn't seem as overwhelming as before. Ultimately, completing this mini-dissertation has been challenging but also rewarding. The process of conducting research and writing a substantial piece of work has significantly enhanced my understanding of factors affecting prosocial behavior and my overall academic skills. This opportunity has prepared me for how demanding my dissertation will be next year and put me in a great spot for what to expect.","Advice: If you are doing a group project, make sure to take advantage of the resources and support provided, especially when it comes to using complex software like SPSS. Perseverance is key, even when things seem overwhelming or confusing.

"Research Design, Teamwork, Personal Growth",Resilient,0.8554,"Creating a mini-dissertation study captivated me, fostering personal growth. This experience honed my teamworking and leadership skills. Though I anticipated challenges, I felt at ease as creating a study entails its difficulties. Choosing a complex topic, namely menstrual cycle, was exhilarating as it's a personal aspect I understand. My tranquility stemmed from the data I had accumulated on this subject through essays, critical proposals, and social interactions. I rehearsed my plan with George in labs, but acquiring participants, particularly females, proved challenging. This experience expanded my comprehension of participant recruitment and efficient data gathering, as building a study is not simple. Deciphering 2x2 data was intriguing yet demanding. Ultimately, my application of menstrual cycle encapsulated key insights regarding a female's period impact on working memory. In the process, I mastered technical content, especially using SPSS, an intimidating yet enjoyable experience. Moving forward, I will prioritize recruiting more participants and preparing for potential errors. I learned how to conduct my own study and am personally satisfied with the outcome; however, in the future, I aim to strengthen my approaches by avoiding failures and valuing eligibility criteria for further research.","Recommendations:

1. When choosing a topic for a mini-dissertation study, pick something that interests you personally and that you have some existing knowledge about. This can help make the process smoother and more enjoyable.

2. Anticipate challenges in your research, but don't let them discourage you. Building a study is not easy, but it's a valuable learning experience.

3. Recruiting participants, especially for sensitive topics, can be difficult. Be prepared to put in extra effort and consider creative strategies to reach your target audience.

"Research Design, Project Management",Resilient,0.988,"This mini-dissertation project offered valuable insights into the research process, particularly regarding the challenges and adaptations essential for designing and conducting independent studies. Initially, our team designed a complex study examining the relationship between anxiety through a GAD-7 questionnaire, stress, exposure to anxiety-inducing stimuli (comparing cute dog videos versus stressful tasks), and subsequent sleep quality (to be measured through a two-part questionnaire completed before and after sleep). However, we encountered several significant methodological challenges that prompted us to rethink our approach. The primary issues included substantial participant attrition for the second part of the questionnaire. Although we had a reasonable number of participants to complete the initial anxiety assessment, fewer than half continued with completing the sleep quality follow-up questionnaire. Additionally, concerning signs were noted on the validity of the data collected - as the majority who completed both questionnaire parts did so within an unreasonably short timeframe (in less than 30 minutes from the start time to submission) rather than the originally expected overnight period from 6-12 hours. This pattern suggested participants were completing both sections in a single sitting, invalidating our attempt to measure the post-sleep effects. These challenges call for the pivotal need to anticipate participant behavior cautiously and implement follow-up mechanisms accordingly, such as sending morning reminder emails (a measure which we had discussed during planning but eventually dismissed due to technical constraints).

   As a result of these obstacles, I have changed the current study design examining gender and ethnicity effects on anxiety, in a less procedurally complex way which still addresses meaningful psychological questions. This experience has given me valuable takeaways about research design, and the importance of striking the balance between ambitious methodology and practical feasibility. As a result of this study, I will bear in mind several crucial considerations when I undertake my third-year dissertation. First, sample representativeness relies significantly on participant recruitment strategies. Our reliance on university forums and group chats resulted in a demographically skewed sample, limiting generalisability. Second, more advanced project management skills will be highly essential for an 8,000-word project, in terms of planning project deliverables along the timeline of milestones. Through studying exemplary papers, I have also enhanced my academic writing skills in presenting the results and discussion sections.

   I found this learning process both enlightening and rewarding. Despite the obstacles encountered, this experience has strengthened my confidence as a researcher and provided practical insights that will be invariably invaluable for my final-year dissertation.","Advice:

1. Anticipate participant behavior carefully and implement follow-up mechanisms such as sending reminder emails to ensure data validity.
2. When designing a study, consider sample representativeness by using diverse participant recruitment strategies.
3. Develop advanced project management skills for managing an extensive project like a dissertation, planning project deliverables along the timeline of milestones.
4. Study exemplary papers to enhance academic writing skills in presenting results and discussions sections.
5. Remember the importance of striking a balance between ambitious methodology and practical feasibility when designing a research study."
Research Design & Data Collection,Reflective,0.8746,"During the mini-dissertation process, the most challenging aspect was deciding on a research topic due to the freedom we had in choosing one. We had several ideas, but found it difficult to incorporate all topics into one. After making compromises and reaching a decision, our ideas started flowing better. When designing the research, we had some existing ideas from past papers that we incorporated into our design; however, looking back now, an experimental measure could have been used for one of our independent variables. In data collection, we found it tricky as most participants completed only the first half of the survey, neglecting the second half about their sleep the morning after. Therefore, we should have made it clearer for participants to complete the whole survey and provided prompts as they went along. During the analysis part of the research, I initially found it confusing but then got the hang of it by ensuring all parts of the analysis were included in my results. Overall, this experience will greatly benefit me next year as I will know what to expect when conducting my own research and have better ideas for my future work.","The student recommends the following tips for future students or themselves:

1. When choosing a research topic, it is important to make compromises and decide on one topic despite the freedom to choose multiple topics. This will help in better flow of ideas.
2. In designing the research, consider using an experimental measure for one of the independent variables.
3. During data collection, make sure participants understand they need to complete the whole survey by providing clear instructions and prompts throughout the process.
4. During the analysis part of the research, ensure all parts of the analysis are included in the results for clarity and comprehension.
5. This experience will be beneficial for future work as it will help in better understanding what to expect when conducting research and developing ideas for future projects."
"Teamwork, Study Design, Perseverance",Resilient,0.9345,"The mini-dissertation process presented several challenges, primarily due to group work involvement. Group members did not know each other personally before starting the project and were introverts, making it hard to build rapport and establish a common purpose. Initially, we struggled with social engagement, adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy for collaboration. Over time, we began supporting each other and working together more effectively. A significant challenge was our larger group size, making cohesive study design difficult. Additionally, we lacked a solid understanding of 2x2 ANOVA initially, which caused confusion.

   A crucial moment for me occurred when I missed a lab session, during which crucial design changes were made without my input. In my absence, other members took on main effects, leaving me with interactions. Once data collection concluded, our tutor recommended swapping one independent variable with one dependent variable to enhance clarity. This placed me in a challenging situation, as I had not been involved in selecting or applying the survey relevant to that part of the project. As a result, I analyzed a design in which I had only been partially involved.

   From this experience, I learned that designing a study is crucial and that a divide-and-conquer approach is not the best way to manage group work. If given another chance, I would choose to be more involved in every part of the project from the beginning. Despite these challenges, I feel good about my submission, and I am eager for the next year's project as I have learned a lot. I have already selected my project topic and met with my supervisor, who agreed with my proposal. I am filled with curiosity about my chosen subject and feel ready to take off the training wheels for the next stage.","The student provides several pieces of advice from their personal experience:

1. Designing a study is crucial: Involve yourself in every part of the project from the beginning, as the design choices can significantly impact the outcome.

2. A divide-and-conquer approach may not be the best way to manage group work: Group members should strive for more collaborative efforts and ensure everyone is involved in key decisions throughout the project.

3. Building rapport and establishing a common purpose is essential when working with unfamiliar group members, especially if they are introverts: Allocate time at the beginning of the project to get to know each other better and define shared goals.

4. When dealing with group work involving a larger number of participants, it may be challenging to maintain cohesion in the study design: It's essential to ensure that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities and communicate effectively to overcome this hurdle.

5. A solid understanding of 2x2 ANOVA (or any other statistical analysis method) is necessary for successful project completion: Spend time learning these concepts before starting the project, or seek help from tutors or experienced peers if needed.

6. Be open to feedback and adaptable when things don't go as planned: The student learned this lesson when their absence led to crucial design changes without their input. They recommend taking such situations in stride and being proactive in finding solutions to overcome any arising challenges."
"Teamwork, Confidence",Relieved,0.9887,"Going into this significant portion of the second year was daunting. Since the beginning of the first year, I found SPSS terrifying, and even thinking about it hurt my brain. However, knowing that I have managed to complete this now, and that this will help prepare me for third year, I feel a little less lost. The experience in many ways was fun! This is the second instance in psychology where I have worked in a team, and it helped remind me that there are other people who may be feeling a little confused too, but you can help each other. This experience taught me that no study is perfect, and that there will be frustrating moments, but you shouldn't be afraid to ask for help. The group I had made the project significantly better as well, as it was nice to be in a mix of people who were a bit more apprehensive (like me) and others who felt confident in the work. My group's good communication also made this a much more pleasurable experience, as there was no anxiety regarding data and contributions to writing. The mini-dissertation did exactly what it was meant to do: prepare me for third year. While I may still feel apprehensive about approaching and designing a study by myself, there is less anxiety.","The student offers the following advice to future students:

1. Don't be afraid of challenges, like learning new software such as SPSS. Even if it seems intimidating at first, persistence can lead to mastery.
2. Teamwork can make a significant difference in completing and enjoying challenging projects. Remember that others may feel just as lost or apprehensive, but you can help each other.
3. Accept that studies may have frustrating moments, but don't hesitate to ask for help when needed.

It felt like this big, scary thing in my mind, and I was honestly really worried. After meeting my group, I felt more at ease as they were really lovely people, and we were able to come up with an idea for our mini-dissertation quickly. I still felt really anxious throughout the process, but it was really nice to have people who provided lots of help (and also my lovely lab tutor). After the research went live things felt easy, I genuinely thought the hard part was over. I had completely forgotten about cleaning the data and data analysis... At first cleaning the data felt really long, and I was unsure what to keep and what to delete however once I realised what I needed and what needed to go it was honestly fun to clean the data and organise it so that it can be inputted into SPSS. Statistical tests are definitely not one of my strong suits, so I found that confusing and I was honestly not expecting my data to be non-significant. I'm really glad we had a mini-dissertation to do. Obviously, during the processes, it made me feel many emotions...and I was really stressed out. However, now that it is over I can look back and feel proud that I was able to conduct my own study (not quite on my own!). I am still really scared about conducting my own research in 3rd year as that will be an independent task, however, now that I have a feel for what it is like I know I'll get through it no matter what and then I'll really feel like a psychologist.","1. Don't underestimate the importance of data cleaning and analysis in your research process.
2. If you feel anxious or overwhelmed during the research process, remember that you have help from your group members and lab tutor.
3. Conducting independent research can be scary, but facing challenges will make you grow as a psychologist.

Research Skills & Personal Growth,Grateful,0.9555,"Completing this mini-dissertation project has been a valuable and enriching experience for my psychology study journey. I enjoyed the entire process, especially data analysis and writing the report. Although the topic was not one I would have chosen (proposed by another team member), it provided me with a great deal of learning. It made me reflect on my own thinking, as I may sometimes rely on unconscious stereotypes. This project deepened my understanding of how easily people use mental shortcuts, such as race as a salient heuristic, when making judgments, especially in a media-saturated world where unverified narratives can shape perceptions. Beyond the theoretical learning, this project offered me the chance to practice essential research skills, from ethical planning and survey design to data analysis and writing up results. I genuinely enjoyed the process and often found myself immersed in the role of a researcher. It made me realize how much I enjoy working with real data and thinking critically about human behavior, which deepened my curiosity about psychological research and strengthened my desire to pursue this path further. Working with a team also reminded me that research is a collaborative process, and that social connection plays a vital role in learning and growth.

"Teamwork, Research Skills, Adaptability",Relieved,0.9938,"This Mini Dissertation was a good experience for me. I was lucky to be part of a group with three other highly engaged and motivated people who shared my enthusiasm for the project. We quickly formed a strong bond and effectively collaborated to generate ideas, support one another, and manage our workload efficiently. Our ability to coordinate meetings and discussions ensured that everyone stayed informed, even when one of us couldn't attend a lab session. We made it a priority to keep each other updated which demonstrated the importance of teamwork and communication. I enjoyed working in a group, as the Ethics application initially overwhelmed me with the workload, but we all worked together to submit it on time, making it less stressful. While we were told it might be difficult to get our target sample population, I was very proud of how efficiently we distributed our questionnaire and how quickly we gathered all the necessary responses. I found the templates on the VLE very useful for setting up a Qualtrics questionnaire and was surprised by how straightforward it was. However, data analysis was hard. Working with raw data in Excel was difficult due to my limited experience, but working with my team to analyze the data together made it manageable. The other challenge I faced was interpreting the data from SPSS.

"Teamwork, Time Management, Personal Growth",Relieved,0.9972,"The mini-dissertation was a group project conducted during the second year. In Term One, we designed an experiment for a 2x2 ANOVA; in Term Two, we executed the experiment and wrote the dissertation. It is essential to note that I previously attempted to complete the second year of this course but had to take a leave of absence due to health issues during the start of the second term. This was my second attempt at designing and conducting an experiment in a group setting, yet my first time analyzing and writing the results. I found this a stressful experience. I believe I felt pressure because it was my second time trying to complete the project, and it was heavily weighted. However, I also discovered the project significantly easier than anticipated, and even enjoyable in parts, such as creating vignettes or learning about my chosen DV. I felt more confident on the second attempt due to familiarity with each section of the process. What alleviated my stress were staying organized and being early for each phase since I naturally take longer than others with certain aspects of work. The best parts of the project were the group I was in. All members were productive and interactive, so I never felt overwhelmed with work. We frequently met up to discuss the experiment outside of lab and had an active WhatsApp group. It was beneficial having a group to rely on when confused, and in return, I helped out the other members as well. We all chose similar DVs for this purpose, enabling us to share our favorite research articles. I understand that my experience was unusual. I believe that the group dynamic I received was partly due to luck but also because we communicated frequently and effectively. In a future project, I would choose to work with this group again as we were highly productive together, completing each section quickly. Initially, we had the opportunity to perform a within-subjects design (which meant we would need only around 30 participants), but decided because we were all very motivated to do a between groups design, which we believed would be more meaningful. I took an extended time to write up the dissertation, starting in the first term, and working on it consistently for a few hours every week until the deadline. I often underestimate how long it takes me to draft. However, this method does allow me enough time for each section, and I never felt rushed. I am satisfied with the final result, and hopefully, the grade will reflect the effort I put in. In conclusion, this assignment taught me a lot. Although the experience was stressful, I believe this is partly due to my personality and because any new endeavor with a deadline will be stressful. I made some good friends during this process and enjoyed certain sections. The most challenging part was writing up; however, I hope the work I put in this time will make it easier for the next one.

Research Methods & Analysis,Motivated,0.9924,"This mini-dissertation project was challenging yet rewarding. Research methods has consistently been my favorite module of the course due to its hands-on nature, which I prefer over the more bookish nature of other modules. The formula of writing lab reports is something I understand better than essay writing, and it also allows me to read and understand scientific journals outside of the course, a valuable skill I've learned during my university years. Our group project was an in-person experiment, which I enjoyed but makes me hesitant about conducting in-person studies next year due to the increased workload, time commitments, and difficulty in acquiring participants, resulting in less generated data. As a first-year student, most of the studies I completed for research credits were online studies, and this is likely the case for most first-year students. This isn't meant to be negative, but rather a consideration of what will yield the best results for my dissertation. If I find a topic I am deeply interested in that requires in-person experiments next year, I will gladly do it and be grateful for the experience gained this year. The analysis was one of the parts of the write-up that I struggled with more than expected, as we've only ever done simple analysis in the past, and this had a multitude of steps. While I understand it well enough in SPSS, when it comes to the results section, I can only hope I provided the correct information in the proper format. I also faced challenges finding resources on the VLE, but once found, they were extremely helpful with formatting, which I find extremely satisfying, albeit a bit nerdy.

"Teamwork, Project Management",Overwhelmed,0.9852,"Overall, this was one of the most challenging assignments I have worked on in my life. From the beginning, the decision-making process was messy. Every week ideas were different from the last and none made sense. It felt impossible to comprehend the assignment, let alone make progress with it. What I learned during the first month of brainstorming is that it may be better to work with people who have some level of intelligence rather than those I am familiar with. Eventually, decisions were made and the process began of forming our experiment. During this stage, task delegation was difficult and there were teammates who did not pull their weight. I wish I could say I learned something about leadership here, but I actually lost respect for two of my previous friends due to their complete lack of will or motivation or even common decency and thoughtfulness towards the rest of the team members. After working through all the initial parts, we eventually made our survey; a task delegated to one team member. However, after putting it out, we realized that some questions had been mistyped. I learned that in the future, I should only trust myself to cross-check other people's work. From that point onwards, there was less teamwork and more duo work, and at this point, I feel disappointed because I believe this study could have been much better if we had a whole team of people who genuinely cared about doing well and maintaining integrity in their work. Next year, I will make an effort to pace myself and have a better plan throughout the project so I won't need to rush it all at the end.","The student provides several pieces of advice or tips for future students:

"Planning, Research Design, Data Analysis, Communication",Resilient,0.9963,"The initial stages of formulating my research question proved difficult as we collaboratively identified the broader topic of VR exposure therapy for public speaking anxiety but isolating my specific focus on motivation proved challenging. This difficulty extended to finding existing research that directly assessed motivation or its interaction with VR exposure therapy and anxiety reduction. Lack of direct precedent made it hard to establish my research question and independent variables from the outset, deviating from established protocols, further complicated the process. In future, I will conduct more in-depth research prior to starting a project, ensuring a clear understanding of the research question and independent variables from the very beginning. Accessing VR equipment presented another hurdle due to limited availability and shared use with other research groups resulting in delays during data collection. For future projects, I will prioritize materials that are readily accessible to avoid similar delays.

While ethical considerations were paramount, finding participants with a debilitating fear of public speaking proved difficult. The relaxed environment, privacy, and lack of time constraints might have contributed to this. Additionally, the VR app ""Ovation"", while engaging, may not have provided a sufficiently realistic experience. Many participants found the VR experience enjoyable rather than stressful, potentially impacting the severity of the exposure. In future research, I will consider including a control group to better determine if observed changes are truly due to the treatment. Furthermore, the reliance on self-report measures raises concerns about potential bias from placebo effects or participants' desire to present themselves favorably. A control group would help mitigate these concerns and enhance the reliability of the experiment.

Analyzing the data using SPSS proved to be the most challenging aspect of the project. My understanding of SPSS and statistics, while improving, still requires further development. The complexity of the study design and analyses pushed me to seek guidance from my lab tutor, take detailed notes, and utilize online resources.
