## What This *Was* Supposed to Be 🗓️

-   A series of dovetailed showcase events for all year groups to present their work
-   A chance to share ideas, get feedback, and build community
-   A celebration of the year’s work, with awards for the best projects at all levels
-   But we forgot about the exams, and the deadlines, and how unlikely it is that anyone would want to present their work instead of revising!

*(Yes, the plan mutated more times than an ANOVA assumption.)*

## What This *Will* Become

| Year | Flagship Event |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Y2** | **Science Fair – “Living Abstracts”**<br>poster + demo + data dive |
| **Y3** | **Undergrad Journal & Conference**<br>peer-reviewed & published! |
| **MSc** | Showcase during PGT Research Festival |
| *(Apology tour)* | Many Y2, Y3 & MSc students are in exams today—catch them next round! |
