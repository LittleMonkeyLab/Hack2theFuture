      <h3 class="mb-3" style="color: #ffffff;">Chris French — <em>The Science of Weird Shit</em></h3>

      <p class="lead" style="color: #dddddd;">
        Ghostly encounters, alien abduction, reincarnation, talking to the dead, UFO sightings, inexplicable coincidences, out-of-body and near-death experiences...
      </p>

      <p style="color: #cccccc;">
        Are these legitimate phenomena? If not, how should we understand them? In this accessible and gratifying session, 
        <strong>Chris French</strong> takes us on a tour of the paranormal — not to confirm it, but to understand why our minds so often generate it. 
        Drawing from decades of research in anomalistic psychology, he’ll walk us through scientific, statistical, and psychological explanations behind some of the most bizarre and persistent beliefs humans hold.
      </p>

      <p style="color: #bbbbbb;">
        Expect light-bulb moments, compelling science, and a few uncomfortable truths. This is not just a talk about ghosts and aliens — 
        it’s a masterclass in <strong>critical thinking, cognitive biases</strong>, and the psychology of belief.
      </p>

      <p style="color: #999999;" class="fst-italic">
        Spoiler alert: it’s not about debunking — it’s about understanding ourselves.
      </p>
