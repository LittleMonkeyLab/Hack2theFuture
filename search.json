Staff have lots of ideas, but we want to hear from you about what you think is needed.\nStaff will be involved in the Hackathon, but we want you to take the lead. We also want you to be able to help the newly arrived first year students get involved in the Hackathon too, exploiting their energy, skills and fresh perspectives.\nThe Hackathon is a chance for you to take ownership of your community and development, and to create something that will benefit you and your peers.\nThe process cannot make wholesale changes to teaching or assessment, but it can help to create a culture of innovation and creativity in the department. It can also help to create a sense of community and belonging among students, which is important for mental health, wellbeing, learning and downright enjoyment. So this is the focus of the Hackathon.\nHow to make the department a better place to study, work and socialise. How to make it a place where you feel you belong and can thrive. How to make it a place where you can learn and grow, and where you can be yourself. Filling in the space not covered by the timetable."

They can be people who are experts in their field, or who have experience of running Hackathons. They can be people who are good at teaching, or who are good at mentoring. Or people with mad skills in a particular area.\nSometimes resources are required to make the Hackathon a success. This could be anything from a room to run the Hackathon in, to equipment or software that you need to use. It could be anything from a projector to a whiteboard, or even just Pizza.

In this accessible and gratifying session, \n        Chris French takes us on a tour of the paranormal — not to confirm it, but to understand why our minds so often generate it. \n        Drawing from decades of research in anomalistic psychology, he’ll walk us through scientific, statistical, and psychological explanations behind some of the most bizarre and persistent beliefs humans hold.\n      \n\n      \n        Expect light-bulb moments, compelling science, and a few uncomfortable truths. This is not just a talk about ghosts and aliens — \n        it’s a masterclass in critical thinking, cognitive biases, and the psychology of belief.\n      \n\n      \n        Spoiler alert: it’s not about debunking — it’s about understanding ourselves."
